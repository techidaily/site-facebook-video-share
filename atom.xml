The sheer amount of videos on YouTube pushes creators to upload videos that have a distinctive visual style to their channels. Adding an intro to a video you upload to YouTube can help you promote your channel, inform the audiences about new videos you’re planning to share online or briefly summarize the topic of a video. Creating an intro for a YouTube video is a time-consuming task that often requires advanced animation and video editing skills. In case you’re looking for a quick solution to this problem you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to reveal to you some of the best online destinations where you can find captivating YouTube intro templates that will make your videos stand out from the crowd.</p><h2 id="Top-Online-Platforms-for-Downloading-YouTube-Intro-Templates"><a href="#Top-Online-Platforms-for-Downloading-YouTube-Intro-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Top Online Platforms for Downloading YouTube Intro Templates"></a>Top Online Platforms for Downloading YouTube Intro Templates</h2><p>Video editing professionals use stock websites and online video editing platforms for a variety of reasons that range from obtaining complementary footage for their projects to discovering templates and other animation graphics.

Here are some of the most reliable online sources that offer a wide variety of mesmerizing YouTube intro templates.</p><h4 id="1-Filmstock"><a href="#1-Filmstock" class="headerlink" title="1.

On the other hand, purchasing the Premium subscription plan enables you to download twenty premium assets per month and to discover new intros, effects or stock footage each day. Filmostocks is a great choice for all YouTubers who edit their videos with Filmora or other versions of this video editing software as well as Adobe After Effects.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-MotionDen"><a href="#2-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="2.

When you’re shooting outside, the most important thing you need to keep track of is the sun. Sun Seeker is the perfect app for figuring out where the sun will be in the sky at any given time, which will tell you the best time to go out and make your video.</p><p>For more information on making videos with natural light, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Indoor Natural Lighting Tips <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Besides just keeping track of the sun, Sun Seeker provides an augmented reality view of its path and how it will affect specific locations.</p><h3 id="5-FiLMiC-Pro-10-iOS-or-Android"><a href="#5-FiLMiC-Pro-10-iOS-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="5.

It gives you exactly the same kind of control over your smartphone camera as you would have over a DSLR. You can manually adjust your focus, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, tint, and color temperature. There are even voice processing audio filters, so you can capture better audio while you’re shooting and have less to fix in post.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Because mobile cameras already perform so well, it can be easy to think to have more to adjust would only make things more complicated. However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevating-your-video-content-youtube-to-igtv-transition/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevating Your Video Content  YouTube to IGTV Transition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-precision-cinematography-ideal-lenses-for-digital-storytellers/"><u>[Updated] Precision Cinematography  Ideal Lenses for Digital Storytellers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-journey-through-the-digital-landscape-six-engaging-quizzes-for-every-vlogger-admirer/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Journey Through the Digital Landscape  Six Engaging Quizzes for Every Vlogger Admirer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/the-power-play-joining-a-music-company-network-in-the-age-of-streaming-for-2024/"><u>The Power Play  Joining a Music Company Network in the Age of Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-earning-strategies-with-youtubes-adsense-payout-per-k-viewers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Earning Strategies with Youtube's AdSense  Payout per K Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/youtube-earnings-average-income-per-video-ad-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Earnings  Average Income per Video Ad for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhance-video-playback-with-av1-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Enhance Video Playback with AV1 on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-efficient-video-marketing-incorporating-timestamps-effectively/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Efficient Video Marketing  Incorporating Timestamps Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-transition-from-mobile-screen-to-big-tv-with-fb-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Transition From Mobile Screen to Big TV with FB Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-golden-threshold-of-youtubes-monetization/"><u>The Golden Threshold of YouTube's Monetization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-optimal-online-discord-screen-recorders-androidios/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Optimal Online Discord Screen Recorders (Android/iOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/cutting-out-clutter-strategies-to-refine-audible-landscapes-with-web-based-audio-processors/"><u>Cutting Out Clutter Strategies to Refine Audible Landscapes with Web-Based Audio Processors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/the-easiest-methods-to-hard-reset-oppo-f23-5g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>The Easiest Methods to Hard Reset Oppo F23 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-insightful-exploration-discovering-the-finest-zero-price-free-audio-design-platforms-on-windows/"><u>Updated In 2024, Insightful Exploration Discovering the Finest Zero-Price Free Audio Design Platforms on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-craft-professional-looking-video-invites-with-these-iphone-and-android-apps-for-2024/"><u>Updated Craft Professional-Looking Video Invites with These iPhone and Android Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-nubia-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgot Pattern Lock?

That doesn’t mean you have to take out a loan and spend thousands to purchase a brand new camera and all other gadgets that professional filmmakers use.</p><p>The smartest way to get started is to go through a list of <strong>necessary equipment for YouTube</strong> and check whether or not you already own some of it. Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important. If you can buy either a new camera or an external microphone, but not both, it might be better to go for the microphone. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here for advice on upping your audio quality without an external microphone. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Sound capturing is every bit as important for your success as your video feed. In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear"></a>Smartphone Camera Gear</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></p><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera. This inexpensive device will give you a lot of freedom to work in space, and allow you to make spectacular shots even without high-end YouTube equipment.</p><h2 id="Equipment-with-Easy-to-Use-Video-Editor"><a href="#Equipment-with-Easy-to-Use-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Equipment with Easy-to-Use Video Editor"></a>Equipment with Easy-to-Use Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-download-youtube-videos-directly-for-2024/"><u>[New] Download YouTube Videos Directly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-the-video-gurus-playbook-smooth-transition-to-easy-youtube-cc-and-subtitles/"><u>[Updated] The Video Guru's Playbook  Smooth Transition to Easy YouTube CC & Subtitles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-dial-back-unrequested-youtube-recommendations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Dial Back Unrequested YouTube Recommendations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-deciphering-the-language-of-youtube-live-images/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Deciphering the Language of YouTube Live Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/the-formula-to-fame-elevating-subscriber-numbers-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>The Formula to Fame  Elevating Subscriber Numbers on Youtube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/streamlining-short-form-content-leading-edits-for-iosandroid-for-2024/"><u>Streamlining Short-Form Content  Leading Edits for iOS/Android for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-list-of-12-superior-flipscreen-vlog-cameras/"><u>[New] The Ultimate List of 12 Superior Flipscreen Vlog Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-streamline-your-thumbnail-design-journey-today/"><u>[New] Streamline Your Thumbnail Design Journey Today!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-harnessing-artificial-intelligence-for-insights-and-predictions/"><u>[Updated] Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Insights and Predictions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-network-neutralizer-overcoming-facebook-intrusion/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Network Neutralizer  Overcoming Facebook Intrusion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-add-audio-to-avi/"><u>In 2024, How to Add Audio to AVI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/explore-6-alternative-platforms-for-high-quality-youtube-graphics/"><u>Explore 6 Alternative Platforms for High-Quality YouTube Graphics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-streaming-stardom-versus-punch-driven-legends/"><u>In 2024, Streaming Stardom Versus Punch-Driven Legends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-vivo-v27e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Vivo V27e?

Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.</p><p>When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.</p><p>Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more. To make your marketing program successful, you must ensure people know about your video and encourage them to click on the links and buy the products.</p><p>Though this can seem daunting at first, the more experience you gain, the more revenue you can generate.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project"></a>Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project</h2><h3 id="Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship"><a href="#Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: build affiliate relationship"></a>Step 1: build affiliate relationship</h3><p>One of the first steps you should take when getting your project off the ground is to establish relationships with brands that you love. If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.</p><p>Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.</p><p>If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up. Chances are they will be more than happy to do so, as it could be very beneficial for them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-relationship.JPG"                      alt="affiliate relationship YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Create-your-product-video"><a href="#Step-2-Create-your-product-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Create your product video"></a>Step 2: Create your product video</h3><p>The next step is to actually produce your video. Viewers love honesty, so don’t be afraid to say so if there is a way you feel the product or service could be improved.</p><p>Remember to include calls to action. Un-boxing videos are very popular and show viewers everything inside a package, whilst review videos can also provide valuable insights.</p><p>Top 10 lists also generate high views. You must also remember to include a disclosure that informs viewers that you are being paid via an affiliate marketing scheme. This is a legal obligation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/product-video.JPG"                      alt="product video YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Promote-your-content"><a href="#Step-3-Promote-your-content" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Promote your content"></a>Step 3: Promote your content</h3><p>There are many things you can do to ensure your product is seen. Share your video on all your social media channels, respond to as many questions from viewers as possible and add links to online environments where the product is already being discussed.</p><p>Set up a channel that can be found when relevant search terms are used and make sure your titles are optimized for search too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote.JPG"                      alt="promote YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Tips-before-you-begin"><a href="#Part-3-3-Tips-before-you-begin" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin"></a>Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin</h2><h3 id="1-Commission-Rate"><a href="#1-Commission-Rate" class="headerlink" title="1. Commission Rate"></a>1. Commission Rate</h3><p>All brands have different commission rates, with some offering up to 50% and others providing around 5%. Make sure you know what the rates are before you proceed and read the terms and conditions carefully. You may well wish to create a dedicated channel or channels to bring everything together. If you’re passionate about other people’s products, it makes perfect sense to get paid to talk about them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comission-rate.JPG"                      alt="comission rate YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Where-affiliate-links-appear"><a href="#2-Where-affiliate-links-appear" class="headerlink" title="2. Where affiliate links appear"></a>2. Where affiliate links appear</h3><p>Affiliate links are placed below the YouTube video in the description. One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.</p><p>It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible. The more views you receive, the more favorably your content will be treated by YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-links.JPG"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><h3 id="3-Know-your-product-well"><a href="#3-Know-your-product-well" class="headerlink" title="3. Know your product well"></a>3. Know your product well</h3><p>It is really essential to know your product inside out when you are marketing it to viewers. YouTube viewers expect you to be an expert when it comes to the products you are showcasing, so take as much time as you need to gain an in-depth understanding of how it works and what its features are.</p><p>You must also be able to explain why it makes so much sense to choose the specific product or service over its competitors. Try not to be repetitive, use HD footage and a quality mic, avoid link spamming, choose the best kind of video for the product and plan out the video before you start creating it. Again, engage with your audience as much as you can.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/know-product.JPG"                      alt="know product"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are various great reasons for getting involved in YouTube affiliate marketing. You may be amazed to see just how much cash you can generate when you follow the above steps and create inspiring videos that showcase products in the best possible light. Just remember to be honest and talk about the cons as well as the pros if they are any. Doing this will help you become a trusted, authentic YouTube affiliate marketer.

Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.</p><h3 id="Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense"><a href="#Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense"></a>Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense</h3><p>For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users’ location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.</p><p>More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p><p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p><p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p><p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p><p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p><p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p><p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p><p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p><h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p><p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?"></a>Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg"                      alt="pay per click"                ></p><p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p><p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click. Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher’s earnings and competition among rival advertisers.</p><p>And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads.

It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video-3"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?</h2><p>In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go. In such a short time, mirrorless cameras have made huge leaps in their capabilities. It won’t be long before the ultimate vlogging camera comes out on the mirrorless market.</p><p>In the end, if you need to edit videos futhermore, try Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It is even more important than your view count. Your view count really only tells you how many people are finding and clicking on your videos, not whether they are actually watching them. Audience retention refers to how much of a video a viewer watches before clicking away, which is very useful information to have. If you know when people are leaving your videos then you know what you need to work on.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to analyse your and your competitors’ YouTube Channel &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to structure a YouTube video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Audience Retention?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: What is a Good Audience Retention Rate on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Audience-Retention"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Audience Retention?"></a>Part 1: What is Audience Retention?</h2><p>To put it in simple terms, YouTube audience retention is about how much of each video your viewers watch. It’s usually expressed as a percentage, so if your viewer gets half way through, they will have a retention of 50 per cent.</p><p>For YouTube analytics, audience retention is taken as a mean of the retention figures for each of your viewers. For example, if you post a ten-minute video and half your viewers get to the five-minute mark, that’s a retention of 50 per cent. If the other half watch it right to the end, that’s a retention of 100 per cent. The mean of these two figures is 75 per cent, and that’s what YouTube will use as your audience retention figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-audience-retention.jpg"                                     ></p><p>This retention rate affects how highly your video is ranked on YouTube, with videos boasting higher audience retention rates appearing higher in the search results than those which do not. This is because both YouTube and Google are highly focussed on customer satisfaction, and a long watch time means a very happy customer was watching that video. For this reason, it’s well worth considering how to increase YouTube audience retention as it demonstrates that you’re making great content as well as helping you get more viewers.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-See-Your-Audience-Retention-Report-in-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-See-Your-Audience-Retention-Report-in-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?"></a>Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube will produce reports to help you keep track of your audience retention. There are two types of audience retention reports; absolute and relative. Absolute allows you to view a graph of your video’s retention and see when people might be clicking away, or if they are skipping to later parts of your video. If you lose a lot of viewers in the first 15 seconds of your videos then that is a clear indication that your content is not what the viewers who find your videos really want. The relative report is where your video is compared to the average retention of similar videos.</p><p>Note that by ‘similar videos’, YouTube means videos of a similar length. There is no way to compare your videos only to other videos in your genre. The relative report will always be somewhat skewed because your videos will be measured against very different content.</p><p>To see an audience retention report log into your YouTube account and go to your<strong>Creator Studio</strong>. There, select<strong>Audience Retention</strong>under<strong>Analytics</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audience-retention.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Good-Audience-Retention-Rate-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Good-Audience-Retention-Rate-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Good Audience Retention Rate on YouTube?"></a>Part 3: What is a Good Audience Retention Rate on YouTube?</h2><p>When you’re considering how to increase YouTube audience retention, it can be good to have a goal in mind. Obviously 100 per cent is going to be the Holy Grail of retention rates, but how many videos are actually going to achieve that? It only takes for one person to ‘accidentally’ click on your video and rapidly click away, or for someone to have to stop for outside reasons, to drag your average down.</p><p>According to the YouTube community, a good goal to aim for is around 50 per cent, but as there is a lot which can affect your retention rate, that number may be different for you. Low view numbers sometimes get higher retention rates because it’s mainly subscribers watching, whereas channels with millions of views may suffer due to more people abandoning. Rather than setting yourself a golden number, focus instead on increasing your retention rate from wherever it is now, and celebrate your own success instead of measuring yourself against others.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention"><a href="#Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention"></a>Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention</h2><p>If you’re serious about learning how to increase YouTube audience retention, here are five of the best ideas for you:</p><h4 id="1-Compare-your-videos"><a href="#1-Compare-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Compare your videos"></a>1. Compare your videos</h4><p>Investigating your audience retention report will highlight the videos where you achieved maximum success. Think about what you did here, and work to replicate that technique. Perhaps you were talking about a product, or maybe your structured your video slightly differently. It’s up to you to dissect your video and find out what it was that kept people watching for longer, so that you can repeat this success in the future. You can also use some influencer marketing platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to take a look at the videos in your similar channels, and learn the popular videos on their channels.</p><h4 id="2-Get-on-with-it"><a href="#2-Get-on-with-it" class="headerlink" title="2. Get on with it"></a>2. Get on with it</h4><p>Research shows that YouTube viewers have an incredibly short attention span. Depending on who you believe, you could have as much as six seconds or as little as just three to grab their attention and compel them to carry on watching. If you want to improve your audience retention, coming in with an engaging, attention grabbing statement right at the start is crucial to your success. Nobody wants to waste their time watching someone waffle on for ages about their granny or their favorite hobbies, so get right down to it straight away, by telling them what’s in store.</p><h4 id="3-Make-it-visually-engaging"><a href="#3-Make-it-visually-engaging" class="headerlink" title="3. Make it visually engaging"></a>3. Make it visually engaging</h4><p>Perhaps all you’ve got is a presentation to make. You’re not a gamer, you’re not showing clips of your cat and you’re not doing a makeup tutorial, so surely all you need is a camera, good lighting and your face, right? Wrong. Viewers like to see the visual content changing, and videos which have a range of scenes are usually far more successful than those where it’s just a person talking to camera. Think about how you can insert cutaways, pop up text, different footage and other graphics to keep it interesting for your viewers.</p><h4 id="4-Make-it-shorter"><a href="#4-Make-it-shorter" class="headerlink" title="4. Make it shorter"></a>4. Make it shorter</h4><p>This one is a no brainer really. If you make a one-minute video, how hard is it going to be to keep viewers watching to the end compared to a 20-minute marathon. However, going too short can be negative too, unless you really do have something very quick and simple to showcase. Long videos work well for YouTubers in the gaming niche, in particular, because viewers want to know the end result, but for most of us, these sorts of viewing statistics are hard to reach.</p><p>If you consider a viewer who watches three minutes of your content, would you rather they watched three minutes of a ten-minute video and then clicked away bored, or would you rather they finished an entire video that was only three minutes long? Both in terms of audience retention and of your own reputation, having a viewer finish a short video is much more valuable to you than losing someone half way through a long one. That person probably enjoyed your content to the end and will more than likely watch another one of your videos. Conversely, the one you lost half way through was bored enough to stop watching and will probably not bother viewing any other videos of yours in future.</p><h4 id="5-Keep-them-hooked"><a href="#5-Keep-them-hooked" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep them hooked"></a>5. Keep them hooked</h4><p>Think carefully about your YouTube video structure. Ideally, you will tell them at the very start that you’ve got something amazing to share with them later on. This could be a tip, a tutorial, a new product reveal or even something funny. Whatever it is, tell them they’re going to love it from the start, and keep reminding them to watch from the end to get this gift. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give them great content all the way through, just that you should save a carrot for the end of the ride to reward those loyal viewers.</p><p>So, now you know how to increase YouTube audience retention, what are you going to do about it? Have a go at modifying your videos to boost the numbers who will watch to the end and let us know how you got on.</p><h4 id="6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="6. Use an Excellent Video Editor"></a>6. Use an Excellent Video Editor</h4><p>Content is the king. It is necessary to use a powerful video editor to help you edit videos. With an excellent video editor like Filmora, you can custom stunning videos effortlessly.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, you’ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p><p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p><p> <strong><a href="#razer">1. Razer Man O’War 7.1</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#audiotech">2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#logitec">3.

HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset</a></strong></p><h2 id="1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1"><a href="#1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Razer Man O’ War 7.1"></a><strong>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-manowar-7.1" >Razer Man O’ War 7.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-man-headset1.jpg"                      alt="Razer Man O&#39;War 7.1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $222.48</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox</p><p>This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset"></a><strong>2. <a class="link"   href="http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/97d660ada89c32c8/index.html" >Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-technica-headset2.jpg"                      alt="Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $299</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)</p><p>For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430" class="headerlink" title="3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/product/g430-7-1-surround-sound-gaming-headset" >Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitec-gaming-headset3.jpg"                      alt="Logitec G430 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $79.99</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p><p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p><p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p><h2 id="4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-kraken-71-v2" >Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kraken-headset4.jpg"                      alt="Razer Kraken Chroma Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $96.77</p><p><strong>Compatible with</strong> <strong>:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p><p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p><p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p><h2 id="5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="5. HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset"></a><strong>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us/headsets/cloud-gaming-headset" >HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperx-cloud-headset5.jpg"                      alt="HyperX Cloud II Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $99.88</p><p><strong>Compatible</strong> <strong>with:</strong> PC, Mac, Xbox, PS4, Mobile</p><p>Well designed, packed with advanced features and moderately priced, this gaming headset offers a lot of value to the YouTube crowd. It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p><p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> b and elegant aluminum frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Advanced audio control box</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Virtual 7.1 surround audio</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Interchangeable ear pads</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Premium look and feel at an affordable price</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Inconveniently positioned mute switch</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Relatively short cord limiting movement</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9</h2><p>No doubt gamers would need a lot of effects and overlays to edit a live stream video to show the best effects on the game screen.

This was used to be a standard television format back then. So if you are a 90’s kid or an adult then you must be familiar with this format while watching your favorite old schooled sitcoms!</td></tr><tr><td>16:9 or 16x9</td><td>The format was enhanced to 16:9 aspect ratio for more HD quality and better viewing experience. This format is widely being used in televisions, theatres, DVD or high definition professional videos.</td></tr><tr><td>21:9 or 21x9</td><td>For more than merely an HD video quality and astonishing user experience, the formats have been upgraded to 21:9 aspect ratio.

These images or called “frames”. Frame rate is expressed in “frames per second or FPS”. The unit or term is applicable for film, cameras, motion capture, video, and computer graphics. This is also known as “frame frequency”, expressed in the unit “hertz”</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong></p><p> Resolution is a measure to entail the clarity and sharpness of an image and most often used as a metric to judge the quality of cameras, monitors, printers, etc.</p><p> It basically refers to the number of different pixels in each dimension which can be viewed in any display device.</p><p><strong>File Size</strong></p><p> File size refers to the space that a file occupies in a storage medium, like hard drive or USB.

The mic’s source of power"></a>1. The mic’s source of power</h3><p>A microphone can draw power from two sources, as you can either connect it to a computer via a USB cable or you can use an XLR cable to connect the device to an external power source.</p><p>The so-called Phantom Power can be any type of adapter or audio recorder that supplies a microphone with power. All professional condenser microphones are connected to a power source through an XLR connection although some mics can have a built-in phantom power source that requires only an AA battery to function normally.</p><h3 id="2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction"><a href="#2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction" class="headerlink" title="2.

You don’t necessarily have to get a binaural microphone in order to create a binaural audio recording since you can just use two different microphones to record the left and right channels individually.</p><h3 id="3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes"><a href="#3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes" class="headerlink" title="3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes"></a>3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes</h3><p>Recording low sounds can be challenging if your microphone is creating humming or crackling noises automatically. The so-called self-noise level a microphone makes is quantified in A-weighted decibels, and ideally, you should get a mic that makes around 15dBA in order to keep sounds a microphone produces automatically at the very minimum.</p><p>Besides the self-noise, you should also look into S&#x2F;N (Signal to Noise Ratio) that depicts the ratio of signal power to noise power. A mic that has approximately 80dBA or more should enable you to record low voices without having to worry about the unwanted noises.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?"></a>Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?</h2><p>If you are thinking about starting an ASMR YouTube channel, you don’t have to get a professional microphone right away, because there lots of affordable mics that will enable you to create crystal-clear audio recordings.</p><p>We’ve shortlisted a few of the best budget ASMR microphones for beginners on the market with the aim to help you narrow down your choices.

YouTube sub for sub is one common practice for this noble cause. In this practice, a person subscribes, in anticipation of the recipient subscribing back as well.</p><p>However, the practice may not give your channel that genuine growth. The subscribers may not even watch your videos or care much about leaving comments or other engagements. All in all, the aim is to hit a certain number of subscribers so that you can get into the recommended territory and probably start earning. But are there other options to increase YouTube subscriptions apart from Sub4Sub? Be genuine and use real avenues to rise to the top. This article corresponds adequately on the matter by giving you alternative ways to gain real subscribers who will stick around to grow your channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-1.png"                      alt="youtube sub4sub"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is sub for sub?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How does sub for sub work?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tips &amp; tricks to use sub for sub</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Additional thoughts - Should we rely on subforsub to get more subscribers?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-sub-for-sub"><a href="#What-is-sub-for-sub" class="headerlink" title="What is sub for sub?"></a>What is sub for sub?</h2><p>Subforsub means a subscription for a subscription. In this practice, there are subscribers and subscriptions. Those who subscribe to you on YouTube are the subscribers while those whom you subscribe to, are the subscriptions. Both video makers’ subscribers are, therefore, increased equally and doesn’t give each other a competitive advantage against the other member. Sub for sub was founded in Germany, 4 years ago. It is easy to use and free platform that takes only about 5 minutes to contact a subscriber and complete the initiative. To get started, a user signs up and creates a new account on the home page.

Simply sub to one another’s channel and they sub back.</p><p>You can do this on different channels such as YouTube live videos, among other channels. But again, these subscribers are not so much concerned about getting the real subs. What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers. And since they don’t watch your videos, neither will they share them with other viewers.</p><h2 id="Tips-tricks-to-use-sub-for-sub"><a href="#Tips-tricks-to-use-sub-for-sub" class="headerlink" title="Tips &amp; tricks to use sub for sub"></a>Tips &amp; tricks to use sub for sub</h2><p>Subforsub isn’t genuine and all you get is bot subscribers who don’t engage.

However, the trick that most subscribers use to gain more subs is by creating other additional fake accounts to gain more subs in return. But again, it is not a guarantee as some subscribers may not sub back to all the accounts.</p><h4 id="Subscribers-don’t-watch-the-videos"><a href="#Subscribers-don’t-watch-the-videos" class="headerlink" title="- Subscribers don’t watch the videos"></a>- Subscribers don’t watch the videos</h4><p>Perhaps there is no time for subscribers to watch the potential sub videos before subscribing.

But are there other options to increase YouTube subscriptions apart from Sub4Sub? Be genuine and use real avenues to rise to the top.

In this practice, there are subscribers and subscriptions. Those who subscribe to you on YouTube are the subscribers while those whom you subscribe to, are the subscriptions. Both video makers’ subscribers are, therefore, increased equally and doesn’t give each other a competitive advantage against the other member. Sub for sub was founded in Germany, 4 years ago. It is easy to use and free platform that takes only about 5 minutes to contact a subscriber and complete the initiative. To get started, a user signs up and creates a new account on the home page.

But again, these subscribers are not so much concerned about getting the real subs. What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers.

When someone leaves a mean, negative comment on one of your videos it will likely affect you. It may make you angry, hurt your feelings, or just leave you baffled over how someone could come away from your video with out-of-the-blue opinion the hater has posted. ‘Do not feed the trolls’ is a mantra that can be hard to abide by. This article will explain why you should not engage trolls and how to talk to them if you find yourself doing it anyways.</p><h2 id="How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube"></a>How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube</h2><h4 id="1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll"><a href="#1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll" class="headerlink" title="1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?"></a>1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?</h4><p> The internet is full of trolls and if you continue making YouTube videos – especially videos that get a lot of views – then you are sure to be attacked by a few. Or, alternatively, a troll may attack your other viewers in the comments of your videos. It is extremely easy to be a troll and so there are a lot of them.</p><p> Most trolls are easy to spot. They leave comments designed to hurt you or make you angry, often using over-the-top offensive language. Not all trolls are so obvious, though. Some trolls will be nice at first – flatteringly nice, even – and it will take a few comments before they turn on you or your subscribers. They want you to like them so you put more stock in what they are saying later and take longer to start ignoring them. Some trolls will even go back to being nice to reel you back in.</p><p> It is important to remember that not everybody who leaves negative comments on YouTube videos is a troll. Step back from your emotional reaction to a comment and make sure there is really nothing constructive in it before you dismiss it. Some people have nasty ways of expressing legitimate opinions, and sometimes even when there is no decipherable meaning behind a rude comment the person is not trying to troll you. Some people just have poor communication skills. For example, if someone leaves a comment on your video that consists of only the word ‘bad’ you cannot know for sure what they meant. It could be that they are agreeing with something you mentioned disliking in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls"><a href="#2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls" class="headerlink" title="2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls"></a>2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls</h4><p> Trolls are bored and looking for attention. When you respond, they win. You may think you are demonstrating to them that they were out of line, or logically proving them wrong, but the troll does not care. Your outraged responses are what trolls want and will only entertain them.</p><p> Also, trolls do not care if they are wrong. They almost always seem to think that their opinions are the only ones that count for anything, but quite often their opinions are not even their real opinions. Chances are they do not actually believe anything they are saying to you they just know what to say to make you mad. Remember that you will always be more invested in any interaction you have with a troll than they are. For them it is a game and they cannot lose because they do not really care. If you take the bait it’s fun, and if you do not then they will move on to a target that will. Even if you put hours of effort into chasing off a troll and manage to make them go away they will have enjoyed the whole thing and you will be left exhausted.</p><h4 id="3-But-If-You-Do…"><a href="#3-But-If-You-Do…" class="headerlink" title="3. But If You Do…"></a>3. But If You Do…</h4><p> While you should avoid talking to trolls, sometimes you cannot. Trolls occasionally start off making kind comments or asking legitimate questions to lure you in. You might be a couple comments into a conversation before a troll reveals their true colors.</p><p> There are also times when you respond even though you know you should not because you just cannot let a specific rude comment go unanswered. It is easy to say you should never feed the trolls, but a lot of people cannot help it. If you find yourself engaging a troll there are a few things you can do to try and manage the situation.</p><p> First, avoid using any emotional language; they love that. Keep your responses either pleasantly detached or dry and factual. Say what you feel you need to say and ask the troll for more information. If the troll has made a false claim then ask them for evidence as if you are genuinely interested in learning more. It is highly unlikely they will be able to provide any, although they may make something up. If the troll has made a blanket statement about how terrible they think you are then pretend you either value their input or find them funny and ask them to explain. They will either leave or respond with more insults.</p><p> You will not get the troll to say they were wrong or apologize so that should never be your goal. What you can do is create a public record of the troll being corrected for others to judge for themselves. If you maintain a calm, unaffected, tone then the troll will find you boring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-viewership-with-informative-youtube-video-captions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing Viewership with Informative YouTube Video Captions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-essential-recording-steps-for-youtube-audio-extraction-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Recording Steps for YouTube Audio Extraction for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements/"><u>[New] Latest YouTube Monetization Policy and Requirements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-evolving-tactics-for-crafting-immersive-mukbang-sessions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Evolving Tactics for Crafting Immersive Mukbang Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/youtube-shorts-demystified-in-30-minutes-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Shorts Demystified in 30 Minutes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-amplify-your-storytelling-seamlessly-insert-music-into-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Amplify Your Storytelling  Seamlessly Insert Music Into YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-behind-the-scenes-what-does-an-unlisted-video-mean/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Behind the Scenes  What Does an 'Unlisted' Video Mean?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-adding-richness-youtube-videos-in-slideshows-for-2024/"><u>[New] Adding Richness  YouTube Videos in Slideshows for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/trivia-trek-exploring-yts-fascinating-figures-and-infographics-for-2024/"><u>Trivia Trek  Exploring YT's Fascinating Figures and Infographics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expert-picked-screen-capturers-of-movies/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Expert-Picked Screen Capturers of Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-unmatched-video-upload-aides-to-twitter/"><u>In 2024, Unmatched Video Upload Aides to Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-automatic-subtitles-for-instagram-stories-and-reels/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Automatic Subtitles for Instagram Stories & Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-online-video-preservation/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Online Video Preservation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/radiant-cinematography-the-ultimate-guide-for-videographers/"><u>Radiant Cinematography  The Ultimate Guide for Videographers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-honor-90-to-outlook-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Honor 90 to Outlook | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-channel-control-center-creator-studio-essentials-for-2024/"><u>[New] Channel Control Center  Creator Studio Essentials for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-record-vr-gameplay/"><u>In 2024, How to Record VR Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mememolding-cutter-for-2024/"><u>MemeMolding Cutter for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-compressor-tutorial-for-final-cut-pro-x-users/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Compressor Tutorial for Final Cut Pro X Users</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There is still the question if the YouTube Video Editor is good, and if it replaces desktop editors. Hopefully, our YouTube Video Editor Review helps you figure out if you want to use the editor.</p><hr><p>Want to make your YouTube video more attractive and beautiful? here I recommend an easy-to-use video editing software - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which not only allows you cut, crop, rotate, and split your videos in minutes, but also simplify the advanced video editing like green screen effect and PIP. You can also find over 300 video effects like Fashion, Beauty, Gaming, Education, etc.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><hr><h2 id="YouTube-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Editor Review"></a>YouTube Video Editor Review</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editor alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from this complete guide.</p><p>In the early days of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/editor" >YouTube Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, all you could do was trim video clips, arrange the clips on a timeline, add in basic transitions, and add music. Now the YouTube video editor is able to add video effects to the video and create multiple projects at the same time. While the editor can do more, it has stayed a simple tool.</p><p>This simplicity makes it very easy and quick to use. Unlike desktop editors, the YouTube Editor processes much faster. Since the tool is designed to be easy to use, you can learn to use the YouTube Editor in very little time. However, due to its simplicity, it does not offer all the same features. Some of the features that are missing means that it is not suited for every project.</p><h4 id="The-Basic-Features"><a href="#The-Basic-Features" class="headerlink" title="The Basic Features"></a><strong>The Basic Features</strong></h4><h4 id="1-The-editor"><a href="#1-The-editor" class="headerlink" title="1.The editor"></a>1.The editor</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-6.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Video Editor review and guide"                ></p><p>The YouTube Video Editor does come with some standard video editing functions like video splicing, Audioswap, and cropping videos. The video editor needs to have the videos already uploaded to YouTube. Along with using your own videos, you have the option to use videos that are part of the Creative Commons library. There transitions, and other features that other standard video editors have. Audioswap is easy to use, and there is access to the Creative Commons library in the editor.</p><h4 id="2-The-Enhancements"><a href="#2-The-Enhancements" class="headerlink" title="2. The Enhancements"></a>2. The Enhancements</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg"                      alt="YouTube video editor review"                ></p><p>The Enhancements that are included in the YouTube Video Editor are not the best tools, but they are still pretty good overall. Enhancements can be found by clicking on a video picture after it has been added to the project. Enhancements are broken into four categories: Quick Fixes, Filters, Text, and Audio. Quick fixes are basic adjustments for small issues like the contrast and saturation of the video. YouTube added an auto-fix button and stabilize video button to make it quick to fix these issues. The filters, text, and audio, are about the same that you would find with any other video editing software.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Want to know how to use the Enhancements feature in YouTube?

It is also super easy to learn. If you have a Google+ account, you can photos to your video straight from your cloud storage. You also have access to all the videos that you have uploaded to YouTube. All the features are easy to use, and many can be dragged and dropped making editing easy. Google is still improving the YouTube Video Editor to have more features and run smoother.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Want to know YouTube alternatives? Check this article to know more: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Editor Alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The major con for YouTube Video Editor is that it only has the basic video editing features at the moment. Another major con is that the video editor is fully online. This means that a refresh is needed to see the changes that you have made. After the refresh of the video, the video jumps back to the beginning of the video making it frustrating to edit the end of a video. There is also no real way of shortening music in the editor at the moment. Unlike many desk top video editors, you cannot overlap music or video clips. This means that some of the transitions are choppy.</p><h4 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h4><p>Since Google is still working on the YouTube Video Editor, hopefully, most of kinks will be worked out soon. While the YouTube Video Editor is getting better, it is still have the most basic features. The easy to use nature of the editor may mean that it stays more of a simple to use video tool. This does make it easy to edit, and it’s good for most projects. Millions of people use this editor because it is so easy to use. However, more advanced projects are still going to need a desktop video editor. We are hoping to see more advanced features in the future.</p><p>Many YouTubers and everyday people like the YouTube Video Editor, for its ease of use and the quick video editing that it provides. However, if it is right for you, depends greatly on what you are trying to do. If you plan on doing any editing past cropping videos, adding type and transitions, and switching music, you are better off using a desktop video editor. Hopefully, this YouTube Video Editor Review helps you figure out if YouTube’s editor is the right one of your projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-peering-into-payment-structures-for-maker-profit-in-video-shorts/"><u>[Updated] Peering Into Payment Structures for Maker Profit in Video Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-content-strategy-unleashed-top-8-youtube-ranks-explored/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Content Strategy Unleashed - Top 8 YouTube Ranks Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/unlock-the-secrets-of-smooth-and-seamless-keying-in-videography-for-2024/"><u>Unlock the Secrets of Smooth and Seamless Keying in Videography for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/2024-approved-youtubes-creative-commons-license-explained-simply/"><u>2024 Approved  YouTube's Creative Commons License Explained Simply</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/in-2024-yts-game-changers-the-elite-ladies-in-gaming/"><u>In 2024, YT's Game Changers  The Elite Ladies in Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/optimize-video-quality-turning-on-av1-in-youtube-settings-for-2024/"><u>Optimize Video Quality  Turning ON AV1 in YouTube Settings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-applications-for-crafting-dynamic-video-entrances/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best Applications for Crafting Dynamic Video Entrances</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-of-virtual-journeys-by-channel-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate List of Virtual Journeys, By Channel for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/transform-your-channels-with-any-of-the-top-11-budget-friendly-naming-solutions/"><u>Transform Your Channels With Any of the Top 11 Budget-Friendly Naming Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/quickstart-free-downloadable-video-intros-for-2024/"><u>Quickstart  Free, Downloadable Video Intros for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/top-10-podcasting-audio-to-text-transcription-software-for-2024/"><u>Top 10 Podcasting Audio to Text Transcription Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/laptop-perfection-10-coolest-downloadable-desktop-photos-for-2024/"><u>Laptop Perfection  10 Coolest Downloadable Desktop Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-safe-and-effective-methods-to-unlock-your-iphone-8-without-a-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 8 Safe and Effective Methods to Unlock Your iPhone 8 Without a Passcode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-beginners-blueprint-for-online-content-simple-straightforward-video-projects/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Beginner's Blueprint for Online Content  Simple, Straightforward Video Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-passport-selfie-maker-top-quality-instant-access-for-desktoponline-use/"><u>2024 Approved  Passport Selfie Maker – Top Quality, Instant Access for Desktop/Online Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-3-step-guide-to-exceptional-gopro-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The 3-Step Guide to Exceptional GoPro Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-top-10-best-sites-to-download-free-hd-video-backgrounds/"><u>New Top 10 Best Sites to Download Free HD Video Backgrounds</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p><p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p><h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p><p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p><p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p><h4 id="What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views"><a href="#What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views" class="headerlink" title="What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views"></a>What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views</h4><p>If your video is removed for artificially inflating your view count you can try to restore it by filling out the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en" >YouTube View Abuse Appeal Form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even if you manage to restore your video, your channel will get a red flag — not the kind you get for copyright violation, but an internal one that keeps the YouTube’s algorithm alert in case you try to do the same thing again.</p><p>Being caught more than once gaming the system may result in your videos being permanently removed or your channel being completely suspended. When providers of views and subscribers advertise their services as safe they are actually saying that their service will not raise red flags with YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>The only way in which they can guarantee that is if they intend on delivering high retention views, which means that actual people will click on your video and watch it from the beginning until the end. There are services that have proven to deliver this level of quality, and if you are interested you should check out <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>Buy Views Review</strong></a>, which is a site that tests and rates these services.</p><p>Buying subscribers is riskier than buying views, but there are still some services that are better than others.</p><h4 id="What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers"></a>What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>While purchasing subscribers for a YouTube channel that doesn’t really make money is looked upon relatively lightly, buying views or subscribers to gain profit is an entirely different matter.</p><p>As you probably already know, YouTube videos are monetized through AdSense, which has far stricter rules about attempts to trick the system. Getting caught by AdSense may result in being banned from using AdSense, which means that your account will be suspended and you will not be allowed to open another account.</p><p>Buying fake views and subscribers to try and turn a profit involves a lot of risks, especially because the financial gain you will be able to make isn’t significant. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >other ways to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than to get subscribers.</p><p>The best advice for YouTube creators who want to buy views and subscribers is to go through official channels. The reason for buying real views isn’t technically against the rules is because Google could be said to sell views itself through its ad services. Paying Google for YouTube views is highly unlikely to backfire on you, while you can also consider hiring freelancers to get you legitimate subscribers and views, the quality of their services can range from excellent to terrible and it will be hard to find reliable reviews.</p><h2 id="Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers"><a href="#Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Other Risks of Buying Subscribers"></a>Other Risks of Buying Subscribers</h2><p>Besides getting into trouble with YouTube, there are other risks involved with buying subscribers.</p><p>The whole idea behind buying fake subscribers is to make your channel look more popular to attract real subscribers, but in order to attract real subscribers, your videos need to rank in YouTube’s search engine. There are legitimate optimization tactics that can help you do that, but it does require more patience.</p><p>The amount of time viewers spend watching your video is the most important statistic for determining how well ranked your videos are in search queries on YouTube and if you buy fake views or fake subscribers, the viewer retention rates will remain the same.</p><h4 id="Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money"><a href="#Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money" class="headerlink" title="Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money"></a>Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money</h4><p>Buying fake subscribers won’t help get your videos in front of real viewers.</p><p>Your channel and your videos will continue to perform poorly in the search results as long as the viewer retention rates remain low. This is because buying subscribers doesn’t mean that you will be buying views or watch time.</p><p>In most cases, subscribers who you have paid for will not watch your videos. If your subscriber count suddenly shoots up, but your view count and watch time does not reflect that growth, YouTube’s algorithm will pick up on that. You may not face any official disciplinary action, but the algorithm will ensure that your videos are ranked very low in search results making it impossible to grow.</p><h4 id="Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers"></a>Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>The best strategy is to grow your channel organically, even though it will take a lot of time. Create a community that loves and follows your work and you will never have to think about how to get fake subscribers.</p><p>If you would like to avoid even the slightest possibility of your channel getting hurt, create content that YouTube viewers will enjoy watching or find helpful, and keep making them consistently. It might take a long time, but you will start to see growth.</p><p>This is the best way to develop a loyal fan base that will help you get more subscribers. Views and subscribers you get from bot farms, which is where most of the bought subscribers and views come from, maybe excellent at imitating the human online behavior, but there will be consequences if you get caught.</p><p>Buying subscribers is unlikely to have a huge effect on the growth rate of your channel. Also, this method for increasing traffic on your channel will not take you a step closer to creating a community of subscribers who can’t wait to watch your next video, which should be the ultimate goal of every aspiring YouTube creator.</p><p>In conclusion, we don’t recommend that you buy fake YouTube subscribers.</p><h2 id="Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber"><a href="#Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber" class="headerlink" title="Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber"></a>Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber</h2><p>Since YouTube is a video platform, your video is what attracts your subscribers.

However, the process can be a bit technical while the results you are going to get may not be visually impressive.</p><p>The first thing you will need to do is create a new project, and select a photo you are going to use as a background. Once you place the photo onto the timeline and set its duration you can proceed to export it as a video.</p><p>You can skip this step if you want to use a video file you recorded with on your own as the background for the intro. In either case, you will have to import the video files you want to use to make an intro into a project you’re working on and place them on the timeline.</p><p>You can then proceed to create a text box and insert the text you want to appear in the intro. Optionally you can apply transitions between the video clips you included in your intro or add music that matches the intro’s style. Preview the intro to make sure that you like the final result and continue working on other parts of your video.</p><p>You can also check the guide to know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to create video trailers in iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An intro can slowly introduce the topic the video covers and it can spark the viewer’s attention.

When you <strong>transcribe a YouTube video</strong>, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:</p><ul><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></li></ul><p>When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>Accent</strong></li></ul><p>If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Repurposing on Blogs</strong></li></ul><p>If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Transcription FAQs"></a>YouTube Video Transcription FAQs</h3><h4 id="1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text"><a href="#1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1.
