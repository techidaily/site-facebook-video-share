In terms of internet it is basically based on the permission of using, copying or distributing content that is available online. YouTube is a video sharing website with its own set of rules and regulations in accordance with its license policy.</p><p>When a user is uploading a video he has option license options that he can choose from. The first option is “standard YouTube License” which means that you grant the broadcasting rights to YouTube. This essentially means that your video can only be accessed from YouTube for watching purpose and cannot be reproduced or distributed in any other form without your consent. The second type of license is the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >“Creative Commons” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>In the below video you’ll learn how to set standard YouTube license and cc license:</p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”"></a>What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”</h2><p>The basic different is that, with a standard license no one can use your video to reproduce as his own work (without clearly marking the video of the original video). However in a standard licence the original video uploader has some right to say “no” to the re-use of his video because the meaning of the video changes altogether.</p><p>However, if you select the creative commons license while uploading then the author may use any portions of work of the original author. It is generally permitted to edit, recompile, change or alter the original work except few listed things. These include copyrights of original work and a clear mentioning that the work has been derived from an original source. Moreover, that the original author will not be held responsible for any damages caused by the derivative work. This is how the two licenses differ from each other.</p><h2 id="3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”"><a href="#3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”" class="headerlink" title="3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?"></a>3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?</h2><ul><li><strong>Is it illegal for me to share Standard YouTube license video with my friends on Facebook?</strong></li></ul><p>It is perfectly alright to share YouTube licensed videos on Facebook or any social media because firstly if sharing was prohibited then probably there wouldn’t have been a share button plug in. Moreover, by clicking share or copy-pasting the URL you are just pointing to the video bearing its original author’s name and URL. Hence, it’s not illegal in any way.</p><ul><li><strong>Can media companies (such as TV show) feature my video without my permission?</strong></li></ul><p>Media companies are generally richly profitable organizations. Hence before using content they need to seek legal permission from the original author of the video. This is especially the case when the owner of the video has used the standard license. It is then mandatory for the media house to take permission from the original video owner who had uploaded the video in the first place.</p><ul><li><strong>Can I use the videos marked as “YouTube standard license” for a non-profit video?</strong></li></ul><p>For a YouTube standard licensed video there is hard and fast legal rule. The original author may claim his work as he has been given certain rights to do so. For a non-profit video yet again you might need to convince him on the fact that you haven’t been gaining anything from usage of his content. So it’s still recommendable to seek permission initially.</p><p>You’ll learn “how to legally use copyrighted music, games, and movies on YouTube” from below video:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-youtube-channel-blocking-a-step-by-step-approach/"><u>[New] Mastering the Art of Youtube Channel Blocking  A Step-by-Step Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-easy-to-navigate-top-10-youtube-downloader-tools/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Easy-to-Navigate Top 10 YouTube Downloader Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/in-2024-your-youtube-shorts-have-been-restored/"><u>In 2024, Your YouTube Shorts Have Been Restored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-bringing-text-to-life-a-guide-to-dynamic-animation-methods/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Bringing Text to Life  A Guide to Dynamic Animation Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-exploring-effective-financial-gains-through-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Exploring Effective Financial Gains Through YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-boost-income-secrets-to-successful-youtube-shorts-earning-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Boost Income  Secrets to Successful YouTube Shorts Earning for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/optimizing-channel-branding-to-skyrocket-subscriber-numbers-for-2024/"><u>Optimizing Channel Branding to Skyrocket Subscriber Numbers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-tecno-spark-10c-mirror-screen-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How Tecno Spark 10C Mirror Screen to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-art-of-designing-smaller-images-thumbnails-explained-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Art of Designing Smaller Images  Thumbnails Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-beginners-primer-to-ps4-gameplay-screenshots-and-streaming/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Beginner's Primer to PS4 Gameplay Screenshots and Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/your-perfect-movie-day-2024s-top-free-films-on-youtube/"><u>Your Perfect Movie Day  2024’S Top FREE Films on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/optimizing-visual-content-adding-black-bar-and-box-to-facebook-videos-for-2024/"><u>Optimizing Visual Content  Adding Black Bar & Box to Facebook Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-find-my-iphone-15-plus-when-phone-is-broken-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Find My iPhone 15 Plus when Phone is Broken? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-6-appsservices-to-trace-any-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-location-by-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 6 Apps/Services to Trace Any Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G Location By Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/action-spectacle-evaluating-hero5b-vs-hero5-session-performance/"><u>Action Spectacle  Evaluating Hero5B vs Hero5 Session Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-spectral-revelations-drone-cams-overview/"><u>[Updated] Spectral Revelations  Drone Cams Overview</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Choosing the right ones at the right moment will help you grow much faster.</p><p>Knowing this, how do you know the perfect hashtags for YouTube?</p><p>The answer is simple. This guide lets you know precisely how to discover the best hashtags for YouTube. In addition, you’ll learn what tools to use and how to always find the correct tag for each video.</p><ol><li><a href="#">Keyword Tool</a></li><li><a href="#">TubeBuddy Chrome Extension</a></li><li><a href="#">VidIQ Chrome Extension</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Bonus: Edit Your Vlog Videos Like A Pro With Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.</p><p>If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.</p><p>This is a list that might help:</p><ul><li>#vloggingmylife</li><li>#vlogginggear</li><li>#vloggerlife</li><li>#vloggers</li><li>#vloglife</li><li>#vlogger</li><li>#vlogging</li><li>#youtuber</li><li>#vlogs</li><li>#dailyvlog</li><li>#vloggingcamera</li><li>#vloging</li><li>#vloggingcommunity</li><li>#vloggerlifestyle</li><li>#travelvlogging</li><li>#vloggingmum</li><li>#foodvlogging</li><li>#vlogginglife</li><li>#newtovlogging</li><li>#disneyvlogging</li><li>#vlogging101</li><li>#vloggingsetup</li><li>#vloggingfamily</li><li>#vlogday</li><li>#kidsvlogging</li><li>#imvlogginghere</li><li>#beautyvlogging</li><li>#microvlogging</li><li>#motovlogging</li><li>#instavlogging</li></ul><p>When using hashtags for YouTube, it’s essential to put yourself in your viewers’ shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.</p><p>For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.</p><p>This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.</p><h2 id="Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags"><a href="#Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.</p><p>The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It’s a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.</p><p>Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:</p><h3 id="1-Keyword-Tool"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool" class="headerlink" title="1 Keyword Tool"></a>1 Keyword Tool</h3><p>This tool’s primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.</p><p>First, type in the topic of your video. For example, “vlog.” Hit Search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag generator"                ></p><p>Then, select the Hashtags panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag tool"                ></p><p>This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="list of tags for youtube"                ></p><p>That’s all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.</p><h3 id="2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension"><a href="#2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension" class="headerlink" title="2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension"></a>2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tubebuddy.jpg"                      alt="tubebuddy chrome extension"                ></p><p>TubeBuddy is a Chrome extension that does much more for your YouTube channel than help with hashtags. It’s an optimization tool that will configure everything for better reach.</p><p>It’s also available as an Android and iOS app. As for the Chrome extension, you install it, and it integrates with YouTube.</p><p>The next time you upload a video, it will analyze it and help you process and publish it more quickly.</p><p>Additionally, TubeBuddy will also show you the best possible hashtags to use for your unique video. Over 1 million people use it. That should be proof enough that this tool truly offers something valuable.</p><h3 id="3-VidIQ-Chrome-Extension"><a href="#3-VidIQ-Chrome-Extension" class="headerlink" title="3 VidIQ Chrome Extension"></a>3 VidIQ Chrome Extension</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/vidlq.jpg"                      alt="vidlq chrome extension"                ></p><p>This is another Chrome extension that helps you find keywords and YouTube tags to get more views. It’s just as easy to use as the previous one. VidLQ has over 2 million users worldwide, proving its usefulness.</p><p>Plus, it has plenty of other features to help you grow your channel. For example, its Competitors Tool will give you insights into what similar channels are doing. VidLQ will also help you optimize your videos to get recommended to more viewers. As we all know, this can significantly increase your views.</p><p>It’s a great tool that can be especially beneficial for beginners. However, because of its simplicity, anyone starting on Youtube should use it. It does most of the publishing for you but teaches you how to do it yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you hope to know more about YouTube keyword tools to get more views, you can read this article to increase your audience: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 Best YouTube Keyword Tools to Get More Views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Bonus-Edit-Your-Vlog-Videos-Like-A-Pro-With-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Edit-Your-Vlog-Videos-Like-A-Pro-With-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Edit Your Vlog Videos Like A Pro With Filmora"></a>Bonus: Edit Your Vlog Videos Like A Pro With Filmora</h2><p>Another way to get more YouTube views is to upload high-quality videos consistently.</p><p>By high quality, we mean no background noise, proper color grading, entertaining soundtracks, and similar.

So, give Filmora a try and become surprised by how easy it is to create a high-quality YouTube video.</p><p>Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags</p><p>Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.</p><p>If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.</p><p>This is a list that might help:</p><ul><li>#vloggingmylife</li><li>#vlogginggear</li><li>#vloggerlife</li><li>#vloggers</li><li>#vloglife</li><li>#vlogger</li><li>#vlogging</li><li>#youtuber</li><li>#vlogs</li><li>#dailyvlog</li><li>#vloggingcamera</li><li>#vloging</li><li>#vloggingcommunity</li><li>#vloggerlifestyle</li><li>#travelvlogging</li><li>#vloggingmum</li><li>#foodvlogging</li><li>#vlogginglife</li><li>#newtovlogging</li><li>#disneyvlogging</li><li>#vlogging101</li><li>#vloggingsetup</li><li>#vloggingfamily</li><li>#vlogday</li><li>#kidsvlogging</li><li>#imvlogginghere</li><li>#beautyvlogging</li><li>#microvlogging</li><li>#motovlogging</li><li>#instavlogging</li></ul><p>When using hashtags for YouTube, it’s essential to put yourself in your viewers’ shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.</p><p>For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.</p><p>This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.</p><h2 id="Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags-1"><a href="#Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed.

What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.</p><p>Choosing the background image from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora’s native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube’s suggested thumbnail size.</p><p>It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don’t have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.</p><p>Filmora’s tools for editing the video thumbnail aren’t too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more.

Another method is to manually erase the background using an eraser. The AI Portrait feature has an effect called “human segmentation.” It separates the humans in an image from the background.

What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.</p><p>Choosing the background image from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora’s native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube’s suggested thumbnail size.</p><p>It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don’t have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.</p><p>Filmora’s tools for editing the video thumbnail aren’t too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more. You can use Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature to easily change it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-2"><a href="#What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?"></a>What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature allows you to quickly remove and change the background of an image.</p><p>Normally, you would need a green screen or chroma key to do that.

In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.</p><p>Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.</p><ul><li><a href="#dumbo"><strong>A map of Dumbo</strong></a></li><li><a href="#postcards"><strong>Post Cards</strong></a></li><li><a href="#bottle"><strong>S’well bottle</strong></a></li><li><a href="#slippers"><strong>Branded slippers</strong></a></li><li><a href="#pins"><strong>Pins, pins, pins</strong></a></li><li><a href="#jacket"><strong>Denim jacket</strong></a></li></ul><p><em>Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures.</em></p><p>The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-2017.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Summit Group Photo"                ></p><p><em>Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit. Turns out</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGlcsogbAQY"><em>he’s a big fan of Lilly Singh</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Thanks to Nick from nickatnyte, for example, we have a pretty clear picture of the kinds of swag YouTube was giving away.</p><p><em>Nick talks about arriving in New York and goes through the swag box waiting in his hotel room.</em></p><p>There were some clues as to what the rest of the summit was like hiding amongst the swag too. Here’s what was in the box:</p><h2 id="1-A-map-of-Dumbo"><a href="#1-A-map-of-Dumbo" class="headerlink" title="1. A map of Dumbo"></a>1. A map of Dumbo</h2><p>The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.</p><p><em>Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo.</em></p><p>Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.</p><h2 id="2-Post-Cards"><a href="#2-Post-Cards" class="headerlink" title="2. Post Cards"></a>2. Post Cards</h2><p>One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.</p><h2 id="3-S’well-bottle"><a href="#3-S’well-bottle" class="headerlink" title="3. S’well bottle"></a>3. S’well bottle</h2><p>S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention&#x2F;conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.</p><h2 id="4-Branded-slippers"><a href="#4-Branded-slippers" class="headerlink" title="4. Branded slippers"></a>4. Branded slippers</h2><p>To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg"                      alt="Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit"                ></p><p><em>thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers.</em></p><h2 id="5-Pins-pins-pins"><a href="#5-Pins-pins-pins" class="headerlink" title="5. Pins, pins, pins"></a>5. Pins, pins, pins</h2><p>There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.</p><h2 id="6-Denim-jacket"><a href="#6-Denim-jacket" class="headerlink" title="6. Denim jacket"></a>6. Denim jacket</h2><p>A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.</p><p><em><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg"                      alt="Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit"                ></em></p><p><em>Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit.</em></p><p>Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!</p><p>Want to join the YouTube Creator Summit in the future?

However, there are certain regulations and norms by the tech giant - Google that you need to comply with in order to get your wallet stuffed.</p><p>With that said, the following sections explain some of the practical methods to earn money from Google and YouTube and how YouTube Shorts contributes to the process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)"></a>How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)</h2><p>The good news is, you are not solely dependent on YouTube Shorts to generate funds from the Internet. In fact, there are several other means that can help you with that. Some of the practical ways that YouTube and Google allow you to earn through include:</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts Fund</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube Shorts Fund is a $100 million fund that is to be distributed from 2021 to 2022. It was introduced in May 2021 as the first step for YouTube Shorts monetization. YouTube Shorts creators that meet the requirements of the fund will receive the bonus.</p><p>To be eligible for the YouTube Shorts Fund bouns, you will need to meet the below requirements.</p><ul><li>Publish one eligible Short in the last 180 days.</li><li>Your channel does not conflict with the YouTube Community Guidelines, copyright rules, or monetization policies.</li><li>Content needs to be original and unique on the YouTube Shorts platform. Uploading movie clips or re-uploading videos from other video platforms are not allowed.</li><li>The creator must be 13 or older.</li><li><strong>Revenue by Advertisement</strong></li></ul><p>With this method, you can have advertisements displayed on your regular YouTube videos. These advertisements help the streaming media generate funds, some part of which is then shared with you. In a broader spectrum, the more videos your YouTube channel has the more money you make.</p><ul><li><strong>Channel Membership</strong></li></ul><p>If you prepare engaging videos that are liked by the majority of users, you can set up your channel for paid members who may get attractive perks in return.</p><ul><li><strong>Merch Shelf</strong></li></ul><p>In this method, you can sell your (or others) branded products to potential customers for monetary gains.</p><ul><li><strong>Influencer</strong></li></ul><p>If you are good at speaking and can motivate people, becoming an influencer is another method you can make a decent amount of money from YouTube with. When you become an influencer, you can get associated with multiple organizations and companies to promote their products and services and get paid.</p><ul><li><strong>Super Chat and Super Stickers</strong></li></ul><p>If you have a good fan base, you can highlight their messages and chat and can charge them for this.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Premium</strong></li></ul><p>You can prepare some engaging and informative videos that are exclusively available for the YouTube Premium members. Because these subscribers have purchased YouTube Premium membership, the streaming platform shares the profit it gets from such users with you.</p><p>The approaches discussed above can help you earn money with YouTube. Now that YouTube has rolled out the plan for YouTube Shorts monetization, we can anticipate more YouTube Shorts monetization in the future. You can also publish your YouTube Shorts video on your channel and the Shorts Shelf. YouTube then suggests these clips to others with similar interests (depending on the keywords that you have added in the description). When such users watch your short videos, the chances are that they would subscribe to your YouTube channel and watch the regular videos that you have already posted, thus helping you make money using any of the methods listed above.</p><p>Another positive aspect of this approach is, the number of views your short videos affects the overall analytics of your YouTube channel (in terms of view count and playback duration), and therefore play a vital role in meeting the minimum requirements as per YouTube policies to get your other, regular YouTube clips monetized.</p><h2 id="Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?"></a>Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?</h2><p>When you start publishing short videos on your YouTube channel, the views that those clips get also affect the total view count and the playback duration of your channel. Although this helps you reach the minimum threshold for the monetization services that the platform offers, because the short videos cannot be monetized, you may see some depreciation in the revenue generation over time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Because YouTube Shorts is still in the Beta phase at the time of this writing, the short videos don’t directly contribute to the monetization process. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, every time your short clips are viewed, your channel’s analytics are affected as per the view count and the playback time.</p><p>Furthermore, with interesting short videos, your channel is likely to get more subscribers, thus resulting in meeting the minimum threshold to becoming eligible and applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program.</p><p>Regardless of the fact that the revenue may seem deteriorated in contrast with the number of views and play time of the videos, the increment in the number of subscribers and paid members (if your channel allows them) would significantly appreciate your income.</p><p>And the most optimistic part is, Google is still working on and exploring YouTube Shorts. With that, the chances are, even the short videos could be monetized in the future.</p><p>The bottom line is, no matter what the current scenario of YouTube Shorts is, you must ensure to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create engaging videos for YouTube Shorts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using any of the tools like Wondershare Filmora in order to attract more subscribers to increase your earnings.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-download-custom-mcb-banner-packs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Download Custom MCB Banner Packs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-privacy-adjustments-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Privacy Adjustments for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-the-top-free-platforms-for-youtube-ops/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Discover the Top Free Platforms for YouTube Ops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-download-youtube-tunes-with-these-10plus-no-cost-audio-crackers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Download YouTube Tunes with These 10+ No-Cost Audio Crackers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-various-ways-to-earn-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring Various Ways to Earn on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-for-quick-chromakey-application/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step for Quick Chromakey Application</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-macos-2023-update-from-youtube-to-high-quality-mp3s/"><u>[New] MacOS 2023 Update  From YouTube to High-Quality MP3s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/spotlight-secrets-perfecting-vlogger-lights-for-2024/"><u>Spotlight Secrets  Perfecting Vlogger Lights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-digging-through-youtube-conversations/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Digging Through YouTube Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/triumph-in-the-digital-arena-discovering-youtubes-top-five-tactics-for-2024/"><u>Triumph in the Digital Arena -

These are all industries that understand the value of quality social media content.</p><p> In the video above, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >beauty YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Gena M explains all the ways there are to make money posting makeup and fashion videos on YouTube. Gena’s most important piece of advice for other beauty vloggers is, to be honest. There is nothing wrong with making money from affiliates or sponsors, so long as you only associate with and recommend products you would actually buy.</p><p>Here’s more advice on how you can make money from your makeup videos:</p><h2 id="Sponsorships"><a href="#Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorships"></a>Sponsorships</h2><p>If you are truly passionate about makeup or fashion then you probably have a few favorite brands. Even if you have never really thought about a brand as your favorite, chances are you purchase one or two types of lip gloss – or any other product – over others on a regular basis.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be nice if a company whose product you already love and use in your videos would start paying you just to mention them?</p><p>There are sites called influencer marketing platforms – the most popular one is FameBit – where you can find brands that are looking for creators just like you to work with them on marketing campaigns. Brands post what they are looking for, and you send them proposals for what kinds of videos you want to make for them.</p><p>Sometimes, creating branded content can be as easy as drawing attention to the brand of the eyeliner you use in a few of your tutorials.</p><p>Other times, brands may want you to say specific things or include logos in your videos.</p><p>Make sure to incorporate any brand messages or product placement you agree to do in ways that will feel natural to your viewers. You should let them know that you have a sponsor, and then incorporate the branded content in ways that do not take away from their enjoyment of your videos.</p><h2 id="Ad-Revenue"><a href="#Ad-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Ad Revenue"></a>Ad Revenue</h2><p>Monetizing your videos and earning ad revenue is one of the primary ways beauty vloggers, and all other YouTubers, make money. It takes a long time to earn more than the pocket change from ads, but so long as you keep growing your audience your revenue will keep going up.</p><p>Pay attention to the estimated revenue reports to see which of your videos are earning the most money from ads (they won’t always be your most popular videos). By making more videos on similar topics you will be able to make more money.</p><h2 id="Affiliate-Links"><a href="#Affiliate-Links" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Links"></a>Affiliate Links</h2><p>By becoming an Amazon affiliate, or joining the affiliate program of another online store, you can make money by including links to products in the descriptions of your video or in your related blog posts.</p><p>For example, if you talk about your new curling iron in a hair tutorial then you can include a special link to it on Amazon. If any of your viewers follow that link and buy it, you earn a percentage of the purchase.</p><p>Even better – if that person keeps shopping, or even skips the curling iron and buys something else, you earn a percentage of any purchase they make on Amazon for a certain period of time.</p><p>Affiliate links are mostly used by bloggers, not YouTubers, but you can still include them in the descriptions of your videos (not YouTube Cards or annotations though). It is not a bad idea for you to create blog posts to accompany your videos and post your affiliate links.

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.</p><p>Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.</p><p>Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera?

Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.</p><p>This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.</p><p>Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.</p><p>Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.</p><p>The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.</p><p>There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.</p><p>Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers. If you find watching your first few videos to be cringy, don’t be discouraged.

PewDiePie’s channel has made this Swedish comedian, Vlogger, and gamer based in Brighton, England, a global celebrity whose videos have reached record audiences. Felix created his YouTube channel in 2010 and in only six short years the PewDiePie YouTube channel received over 16 billion views and it is currently among the most viewed channels ever.</p><p>The most common videos on Felix’s channel are gaming videos in which he comments and reacts to the game as he plays through it. PewDiePie’s videos are full of goofy and genuine content that amuses its spectators. Felix’s YouTube channel remains by far the most subscribed channel with more than 57 million subscribers, more than 25 million more than the channel in second. He frequently appears in marketing campaigns and other social media events and is widely considered as the most influential gaming commentator of our time.</p><h3 id="2-HolaSoyGerman"><a href="#2-HolaSoyGerman" class="headerlink" title="2.

Furthermore, HolaSoyGerman’s channel is the most subscribed Spanish-speaking channel today. Germán’s second YouTube channel JuegaGerman has made him the only YouTuber ever to receive two diamond play buttons for having over 40 million subscribers on his two channels.</p><p>The Chilean YouTube superstar uploaded his first YouTube video in 2011 and by October 2012 his channel has reached 1 million subscribers. Recently, German has lent his voice to a character in the Spanish version of Ice Age: Collision Course. He finds inspiration for his comic YouTube videos in everyday life and topics like ex-girlfriends, school, and phobias are frequently covered in videos published on the HolaSoyGerman channel. In 2014 and 2015 German won the ‘Icon of the Year’ prize from MTV Millennial Awards.</p><h3 id="3-ElrubiusOMG"><a href="#3-ElrubiusOMG" class="headerlink" title="3.  ElrubiusOMG"></a>3.

The El Rubius OMG channel was created by Rubén Doblas Gundersen in December 2011 and by February 2013 it reached 1 million subscribers. However, Rubén has been producing videos for his Elrubius channel since 2006. He simply became more dedicated to the frequent production of YouTube videos in 2011. Even though the videos featured on the El Rubius OMG channel mostly cover video games, Rubén also produces comedy videos, vlogs, and other interesting and amusing content.</p><p>Based in Madrid, El Rubius OMG first became popular in Spanish-speaking countries, and as his fame increased he gained recognition throughout the world. During 2012 his channel became the most subscribed Spanish speaking channel, and on April 21, 2016, El Rubius received the ‘YouTuber of the Year’ award during the 1st Play Awards celebration in Palma De Mallorca. In addition to being one of the most popular YouTubers of all time, Rubén is also a published author whose first book ‘The Troll Book’ was the bestselling book in Spain for 8 weeks.</p><h3 id="4-Smosh"><a href="#4-Smosh" class="headerlink" title="4.

They started the Smosh YouTube channel in 2005 and since then they have grown their team to include more creators, and their content to include animation and gaming. Smosh has become much more than two funny guys on YouTube – it is a wildly successful content company.</p><p>Most channels that have one viral video do not go on to have sustained success on YouTube, but Smosh is an exception to this rule. Their ‘Pokemon Theme Music Video’, released in 2005, became the most viewed video of all time (as of that year). This video kick-started the growth of their channel.</p><p>In 2017, Anthony Padilla chose to leave Smosh to focus on his own solo YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="5-Fernanfloo"><a href="#5-Fernanfloo" class="headerlink" title="5.

A 24-year-old Salvadoran named Luis Fernando Flores Alvarado is the man behind one of the most subscribed YouTube channels of all time. The Fernanfloo channel was created in 2011, and in February 2014 it had only 100,000 subscribers. By August 2014, Alvarado’s channel reached 1 million subscribers, making him one of YouTube’s biggest success stories.

Everyone knows that big YouTubers get paid through the ads that play ahead of their videos. More and more YouTubers keep showing how much money they are making from YouTube via the lifestyles they lead. It begs the question - how much money do YouTubers make?</p><p>One of the main questions is “how many views do you need to start making money on YouTube?” The answer to this question is complicated. You need 4,000 hours of annual viewing time and 1,000 subscribers on your channel to sign up for monetization, but just being able to monetize your videos doesn’t mean you’re going to make money.</p><p>The reason is that YouTubers are not paid per view, they are paid per ad impression.</p><ul><li><a href="#types">Types of YouTube Ads - What is an Ad Impression?</a></li><li><a href="#cpi">CPI Rates Explained</a></li><li><a href="#bigyoutubers">How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</a></li><li><a href="#milestone">Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</a></li></ul><p>Want a fast answer about how much money a YouTuber makes? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out these calculators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression"><a href="#Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression" class="headerlink" title="Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?"></a>Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?</h2><p>If you ask YouTubers about how much they make per thousand views, you’ll probably get a different answer depending on the person on who you ask. You may have already heard things like $5 per thousand views or $1,000 per 1 million views, but neither of these is for sure.</p><p>Google’s AdSense service, through which YouTubers make money, pays YouTubers for ad impressions. For most types of ads – including short pre-roll ads, the ads which appear at the bottoms of videos while they play, and the ads which appear as banners to the side of YouTube’s player – an ad impression means someone clicking on the ad and choosing to visit the advertiser’s site. One exception is skippable video ads, for which an impression is created when a viewer watches the ad for 30 seconds.</p><p>YouTubers do not make money on the views of their videos, because not all viewers click on ads. Many viewers bypass ads completely using ad-blockers. The amount of money YouTubers earn from a single ad impression is called their CPI or “cost per impression.”</p><h2 id="CPI-Rates-Explained"><a href="#CPI-Rates-Explained" class="headerlink" title="CPI Rates Explained"></a>CPI Rates Explained</h2><p>YouTube advertising is currently managed inside the AdSense platform. In case you’re not familiar with AdSense, you can have 2 different kinds of ads - the cost per click (CPC) or the cost per view (CPV).</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-Click-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-Click-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per Click ads"></a>Cost Per Click ads</h4><p>The advertiser pays based on how many clicks he was able to get with that particular ad. These kinds of ads usually appear on the right side of your YouTube channel or they can also appear at the bottom of the screen, during the video.</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-View-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-View-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per View ads"></a>Cost Per View ads</h4><p>the advertiser will pay based on the views he had of the ad and not based on the clicks he was able to generate. One of the things that many people aren’t aware of is the fact that the viewer needs to spend at least 30 seconds watching the ad or half the ad, whichever comes first. This means that a single viewer can continue clicking on the ad multiple times that the advertiser won’t be billed for all those clicks because he is only paying for views.</p><h4 id="Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos"></a>Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos</h4><p>If any of your friends ever suggest that they are going to do so to help you out tell them not to. AdSense has a rate of ad-clicks that it considers normal and if you get significantly more clicks than that it will think you’re artificially pushing that number up by either clicking yourself or having someone do it for you. If this happens they will ban you from AdSense and, although there is an appeals process, it is unlikely you will ever get your account back and be able to monetize videos again.</p><p>How much you make from an ad on YouTube depends on your CPI, cost per impression. Simply put, this is the rate that YouTube will pay you for every 1,000 views or clicks of the ads that are attached to your videos. Even though it would be a lot simpler if YouTube had their current CPI rates available, they don’t. These rates vary depending on the ad, the types of videos you make, and how popular your channel is. It is actually against YouTube’s rules for YouTubers to share their personal CPI rates publicly.</p><p>Most people tend to assume that CPI rates are between $0.05 and $10. This huge difference is justified by YouTube by saying that they use a very complicated algorithm to determine your CPI rate. According to them, it includes evaluating factors like the ads, the type of audience who views your video, audience engagement, audience retention, and the price of the ads.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?"></a>How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</h2><p>Many people are aspiring to make money as famous YouTubers, but it is not an easy task. You have a long way to go before you start making any money at all.</p><p>In general, it’s reasonable to expect to start earning some money when you get to 1 million subscribers. This is the point at which you can start treating YouTube as your job, but the truth is that you will still not be making amazing money. At 1 million subscribers you will only be starting to be seen as someone important in your industry. You won’t even necessarily be “YouTube famous” yet – there are a lot of channels with 1 million subs.</p><p>Even though most people think that YouTube channels with 1 million subscribers are already making a good amount of money and that they are already at the top, the truth is that they’ve just started climbing. They aren’t even near the top. Just to give you a better idea, there are more than 2,400 YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers.</p><p>According to Google, when an advertiser pays $100 to Google, Google pays $68 to the publisher (in this case, the publisher is a YouTube creator).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-much-do-youtubers-make.png"                      alt="How Much Do YouTuber Makes"                ></p><p><em>This graphic won’t apply to every situation because every situation is unique. It’s just an example using assumed numbers.</em></p><h4 id="How-much-money-for-1-000-YouTube-views"><a href="#How-much-money-for-1-000-YouTube-views" class="headerlink" title="How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?"></a>How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?</h4><p>15% of 1,000 is 150</p><p>150x CPI ($0.18) &#x3D; $27*</p><p>51% of $27 &#x3D; $13</p><p>Using these rates, 1000 views are worth $13!</p><p>*CPI vary</p><p>Assuming that the average rate is about $0.18 per impression, you still need to factor in that most people don’t click on ads or watch skippable video ads for 30 seconds. Only about 15% of viewers tend to watch the complete ad (or, at least half of it). So, considering that you have 1,000 views on your video, only 150 viewers watched your complete ad. So, at $0.18 per view, Google will charge $27 to the advertiser and the YouTube channel will get 51% of that, meaning the creator will earn $13 per 1,000 views.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to know how much YouTube pays for 1 million views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><p>It will take you a long time to start earning enough money to support yourself through AdSense. That’s why AdSense isn’t the primary way that huge YouTube stars make money. In addition to AdSense revenue you can (and should) also consider other opportunities such as product placement, endorsements, and brand sponsorships. Many YouTubers also make some money from selling their merchandise.</p><p>Some YouTubers earn millions of dollars every year. Although the exact numbers have never been disclosed, many different websites have made educated guesses.</p><p>Forbes publishes an annual list of the highest-paid YouTubers, which includes revenue from things like book deals and makeup lines. It is useful to look at this list gain have some perspective about how big YouTubers make their money, and how big they had to get to make it.</p><p>As of 2017, YouTube gamer Daniel Middleton (DanTDM) is the highest-paid YouTuber earning 16 million dollars. He is followed by gamer Evan Fong (Vanoss Gaming) with $15.5 million, Dude Perfect with $14 million, and Mark Fischbach (Markiplier) and Logan Paul with $12.5 million. However, as we already mentioned, even though a substantial part of the income of these YouTube stars comes from YouTube&#x2F;AdSense, the bulk of it comes from things like merchandise and sponsorships.</p><p>Instead of relying on YouTube to pay them, YouTubers need to seek out other ways of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >leveraging the YouTube platform to earn money <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>We all agree that being a YouTube star isn’t an easy path. However, if you honestly love what you do, then you will be willing to put effort into making great videos regularly. Part of that is also being willing to take the time to promote them and yourself, as well as putting time and effort into forging a good relationship with your audience.</p><h2 id="Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views"><a href="#Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views" class="headerlink" title="Why No Longer 10,000 Views?"></a>Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</h2><p>YouTube used to let anybody monetize their videos, but that has now changed. Then for a while, you’ll qualify for monetization after reaching 10,000-lifetime views on your channel. But as of 2018, the rules to YouTube monetization has gotten more challenging.</p><p>To monetize you must have:</p><p>- 4,000 of annual watch time</p><p>- 1,000 subscribers</p><p>The reason for this is that YouTube was having trouble with channels that were trying to monetize stolen or inappropriate content, besides, YouTubers are gaming the system by using automated programs to gain more views. By making creators get more watch time and subscribers before they apply for monetization, YouTube has been able to create a review process in which they can prove that the channel has a legitimate audience and stop content thieves and criminals from making money. Naturally, this new rule also makes it very difficult for new YouTubers to make money.</p><p><em>Are you finding it difficult to earn money on YouTube?

Even though there are only a handful of channels built entirely around <strong>reaction videos</strong>, this genre of videos can help you make your channel more diverse.</p><p>However, copyright restrictions prevent you from commenting on any video you find interesting, which is the reason why you have to get creative while choosing the next idea for a reaction video. So, in this article we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best YouTube video reaction ideas</strong> you can use to comment on different types of YouTube videos.</p><p>Previously we have demonstrated <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to create a YouTube reaction video with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, check it to get some inspiration.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><h2 id="10-Best-YouTube-Video-Reaction-Ideas-You-Should-Try-in-2021"><a href="#10-Best-YouTube-Video-Reaction-Ideas-You-Should-Try-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="10 Best YouTube Video Reaction Ideas You Should Try in 2021"></a>10 Best YouTube Video Reaction Ideas You Should Try in 2021</h2><p>The process of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making a YouTube video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> starts with an idea and the idea you choose often determines how good that video is going to be. The fact that reaction videos are so popular on YouTube right now, makes the idea selection even more important because just one good idea may boost your number of followers significantly. Here are some of the best video reaction ideas you can use to comment on different topics.</p><h3 id="1-React-to-music-videos"><a href="#1-React-to-music-videos" class="headerlink" title="1. React to music videos"></a>1. React to music videos</h3><p>Music videos are among the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, which makes them perfect to react to. You can share your opinion about the musician, their latest work or the video’s visual aspects. Obtaining the copyrights to the music video you would like to comment on is very important, because you may be forced to delete your reaction video if you don’t.</p><h3 id="2-Video-game-reactions"><a href="#2-Video-game-reactions" class="headerlink" title="2. Video game reactions"></a>2. Video game reactions</h3><p>Video games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto attract a lot of attention on YouTube, and if you are a fan of any of them you can easily react to the gameplay. Reacting to video games is only a good idea if your channel is dedicated to gaming, because otherwise, this reaction video idea may seem off-topic.</p><h3 id="3-React-to-video’s-comments"><a href="#3-React-to-video’s-comments" class="headerlink" title="3. React to video’s comments"></a>3. React to video’s comments</h3><p>YouTubers that already have thousands of followers need to keep coming up with new ways to engage their audience. Encouraging the viewers of your videos to comment on them can be a valuable source of ideas for reaction videos. You can comment on the topics that were discussed in the comments and address particular questions your followers have asked you.</p><h3 id="4-Make-a-‘Kids-React-To’-videos"><a href="#4-Make-a-‘Kids-React-To’-videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a ‘Kids React To’ videos"></a>4. Make a ‘Kids React To’ videos</h3><p>Videos of children reacting to different genres of music are already getting thousands of views every day. So, if you like working with children you should consider making a variation of this type of video. There are so many different things children can react to, you just have to find a few that fit perfectly into your channel’s topic.</p><h3 id="5-React-to-‘React-To’-Videos"><a href="#5-React-to-‘React-To’-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5. React to ‘React To’ Videos"></a>5. React to ‘React To’ Videos</h3><p>Even though reacting to a reaction video sounds silly, it is anything but because by doing so you will open up space for a dialogue with other YouTubers. Besides being funny, this is also an opportunity to give your two cents on topics that are most relevant for your channel. In addition, the YouTube audience loves collaborations between YouTubers, which will give you and your associates the opportunity to increase the size of your audience.</p><h3 id="6-Comment-on-your-old-videos"><a href="#6-Comment-on-your-old-videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Comment on your old videos"></a>6. Comment on your old videos</h3><p>Producing new content for your YouTube channel regularly is important for so many reasons, but recycling old material from time to time can allow you to reflect on the topics you already covered. In addition, you’ll remind your viewers of your old videos and give them the reason to watch them again. Opting to comment on the videos you made in the past can also help you avoid potential copyright complications.</p><h3 id="7-Record-reactions-of-elderly-people"><a href="#7-Record-reactions-of-elderly-people" class="headerlink" title="7. Record reactions of elderly people"></a>7. Record reactions of elderly people</h3><p>It becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the latest pop culture trends as we get older. That’s why elderly people often have trouble understanding the taste of younger generations. Recording their reactions to fashion choices young people make or the music they listen to can be hilarious, which makes it an excellent reaction video idea.</p><h3 id="8-React-to-different-challenges"><a href="#8-React-to-different-challenges" class="headerlink" title="8. React to different challenges"></a>8. React to different challenges</h3><p>Over the course of the last decade, we’ve seen so many challenges go viral, as even the world’s most famous politicians took part in some of them. Challenge videos are not as popular as they used to be a few years ago, but they still amass thousands of views. Making funny reaction videos to different challenge videos may help you boost your number of followers, especially if you come up with witty remarks for each video you comment on.</p><h3 id="9-React-to-TV-shows"><a href="#9-React-to-TV-shows" class="headerlink" title="9. React to TV shows"></a>9. React to TV shows</h3><p>We all love watching a good TV show, whether it is a TV series or a reality show. So, if you are looking for a reaction video idea that can hardly fail, commenting on a TV show may be the right choice for you. However, getting the right to use the footage you would like to comment on may be difficult, as making the reaction video without permission from the copyright owner may have legal implications.</p><h3 id="10-Comment-on-movie-trailers"><a href="#10-Comment-on-movie-trailers" class="headerlink" title="10. Comment on movie trailers"></a>10. Comment on movie trailers</h3><p>If you are running a movie channel on YouTube, your followers are expecting your comment on the latest releases.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

Sony’s Cyber-shot series is famous for its cutting-edge features and the DSC-RX 100 V model is not an exception. This camera is equipped with a 20.1 MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor that supports ISO sensitivities up to ISO 12800. You can record footage in UHD 4K at 30 or 24 fps, although with a five-minute limit, as well as Full HD videos at a maximum of 960 fps when recording in the HFR mode. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX 100 V ships with a non-interchangeable Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T lens that performs well under low-light conditions and in broad daylight. The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording. DSC RX-100 V’s multi-functionality makes it one of the best cameras for daily vlogging, especially for vloggers who are planning on shooting vlogs in various locations.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Light and easy to carry around</em> <em>- Produces high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Short battery life</em> <em>- Lacking a touchscreen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best cheap vlogging camera: Canon EOS M100 Canon’s EOS M100 is small and powerful. This mirrorless camera produces full HD videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t, however, shoot 4K footage. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 7 image processor ensure that your vlogs are always in focus and rich in detail. The Canon EOS M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options, offering ISO values as high as 25600, making it a great option for vloggers that often shoot their videos under difficult light conditions. The 3-inch touchscreen LCD lets you control focus points, navigate through the camera’s menu, or watch videos you’ve created. The screen can also be tilted in the upward direction to provide you a better preview of the shot you’re recording. The camera has a built-in Wi-Fi with NFC so you can transfer your videos seamlessly to a computer and have fun in the process. The Canon EOS M100 is currently one of the best entry-level cameras for daily vlogging on the market because it produces videos in great picture quality that you don’t have to spend a fortune for.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Affordable</em> <em>- Great connectivity options</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Lacks advanced video recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 wins this category as well in our books because it’s a powerful, feature-rich camera that’s also very affordable.

That’s why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera’s 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There’s very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800</em> <em>- High video bit rates</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Expensive</em> <em>- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price. The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 has a DIGIC 7 image processor and a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor that lets you extend the ISO value to 51200 and shoot your vlogs even under low light conditions. This camera can capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, and it features a 9-point AF system and dual pixel CMOS AF technologies that provide precise and quick focusing even when there is not much light. The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D’s 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-snicker-sounds-hilarious-song-imitations/"><u>[Updated] Snicker Sounds  Hilarious Song Imitations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/2024-approved-vimeo-and-youtube-a-compreayer-of-their-core-philosophies/"><u>2024 Approved  Vimeo and YouTube  A Compreayer of Their Core Philosophies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/total-view-team-up-choosing-the-right-mcn-for-2024/"><u>Total View Team-Up  Choosing the Right MCN for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-clear-cinematic-vision-top-camera-stabilizers-reviewed/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Clear Cinematic Vision - Top Camera Stabilizers Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/profit-strategies-in-youtube-marketing-for-2024/"><u>Profit Strategies in YouTube Marketing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-banishing-black-edges-on-your-youtube-video/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Banishing Black Edges on Your YouTube Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-step-by-step-breakdown-creating-your-best-yt-shorts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  A Step-by-Step Breakdown  Creating Your Best YT Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-achieving-visual-excellence-aspect-ratio-mastery-on-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, Achieving Visual Excellence  ASPECT RATIO Mastery on YOUTUBE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-tiktok-marketing-best-practices-and-success-stories/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to TikTok Marketing  Best Practices and Success Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-audio-mastery-for-quicktime-videos-advanced-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Updated Audio Mastery for QuickTime Videos Advanced Tips & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ifunny-memes-unlocked-download-and-use-in-a-flash/"><u>[New] In 2024, IFunny Memes Unlocked  Download & Use in a Flash</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-instagram-videos-understanding-time-constraints-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Instagram Videos  Understanding Time Constraints for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-tecno-spark-10c-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from Tecno Spark 10C to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/seeing-beyond-our-elite-rankings-of-camera-lenses-1-10-for-2024/"><u>Seeing Beyond  Our Elite Rankings of Camera Lenses #1-10 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-dive-into-action-4-easy-steps-for-audience-captivating-instagram-loops-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Dive Into Action  4 Easy Steps for Audience-Captivating Instagram Loops for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-raw-footage-to-polished-videos-imovies-role-in-youtube-content-creation/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Raw Footage to Polished Videos  IMovie's Role in YouTube Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-are-you-looking-to-make-a-thumbnail-for-your-fortnite-video-this-article-features-a-guide-explaining-creating-a-fortnite-motion-blur-thumbnail/"><u>New Are You Looking to Make a Thumbnail for Your Fortnite Video?

Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized.

The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization-1"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid-1"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid-1" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money-1"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View-1"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View-1"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model-1"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers-1"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers-1" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube-1"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized. Other ways of making money on YouTube include</p><ul><li>Selling branded merch or courses</li><li>YouTube Premium subscriber’s subscription fee</li><li>Recurring monthly payments by members for special benefits</li><li>Highlight fan’s messages in chat streams</li><li>Sponsorships by partnering with brands to promote their products or services</li><li>Affiliate marketing</li><li>Brand deals</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora-1"><a href="#Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora"></a><strong>Part 3.</strong> **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora</h2><p>Good content will increase audience engagement and grow your YouTube channel.

If you’d like to learn how to make money on YouTube, we’re going to look at eight ways of generating an income via your videos. Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-money-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-make-money-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to make money on YouTube"></a>How to make money on YouTube</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Make money on YouTube with ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Make money on YouTube without ads</a></li></ul><p>We’ve discovered that making money on YouTube can be split into two main categories; making money through advertising or making money without ads involved. We’ve split our article into these two categories to make it easier for you to see what your options are.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube with ads"></a>Make money on YouTube with ads</h3><p>By far the easiest way to start earning money on YouTube is to monetize your channel using ads. Until relatively recently, anyone could enable monetization on their YouTube channel and start earning for every watch of their video. But that all changed in January this year, when Google announced they would be raising the standards required to have ads shown on your channel.</p><p>Now, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which means you need to have met certain minimum criteria before you can start benefitting from ads. These include:</p><ul><li>Having 4,000 or more watch hours</li><li>Securing 1,000 or more subscribers in the last 12 months</li></ul><p>This means that, before you can even consider being a part of the YPP, you’ll need to knuckle down and grow your subscribers. There’s lots of helpful tips out there on increasing subscriber numbers, but it all boils down to creating excellent content. As they say, ‘if you build it, they will come’, so work on creating new and exciting content for your channel to get where you need to be.</p><h4 id="Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not"><a href="#Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Should you join YouTube partner or not?"></a>Should you join YouTube partner or not?</h4><p>Meeting the minimum requirements of the YPP is crucial to starting to host ads, but even when you’ve hit the 1k subscribers and 4k hours viewed, should you be monetizing your channel right away? Put it this way; in order to make any money from ads, you’re going to need a lot of views and loyal subscribers, which means your focus needs to be firmly on creating content rather than complying with advertising rules.</p><p>Sometimes it’s actually better to hold off for a while when you’re early on in your YouTube journey. This will mean that, rather than being distracted by the question of how to earn money from YouTube, your energy is targeted at what matters most, which is building up a library of awesome videos instead.</p><h4 id="How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?"></a>How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?</h4><p>1. Go to your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and, under <strong>Channel</strong>, select <strong>Status and features</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-creatorstudio.JPG"                      alt="monetize creatorstudio"                ></p><p>2. Click on <strong>Enable</strong> next to <strong>Monetization</strong>.</p><p>3. In the next screen, click the blue <strong>Enable my Account</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-enablescreen.JPG"                      alt="monetize enablescreen"                ></p><p>4. <strong>The YouTube Partner Program Terms</strong> will pop up. Compared to a lot of the “Terms” you are asked to read and agree to when signing up for things online the Partner Terms are fairly short and readable.</p><p>5. After reading the terms there are three boxes you will need to check to proceed. The first is to confirm that you read the Terms. The second box is a promise not to click on the ads in your own videos to try to create profits artificially.</p><p>The third box requires you to promise not monetize content that you do not own. The most extreme version of this would be stealing somebody else’s video and trying to monetize it on your channel. However, using a song or sound effect in your video you do not have the rights to also counts. There are a lot of places you can get free music to use in your monetized videos, and YouTube’s own Audio Library is one of them.</p><p>6. After you have checked all the boxes and moved on you will see a pop up explaining how to monetize your individual videos.</p><p>Your channel is now monetized, but you will not be able to earn money until you have linked your channel to your AdSense account.</p><p>7. There will be a reminder to link your channel and your AdSense account in the next screen. Click on the <strong>Link my account</strong> button. Or, go to Google.com&#x2F;adsense and click <strong>Sign Up Now</strong>. Either method will take you to the Welcome to AdSense page.</p><p>8. Click <strong>Sign In</strong> to sign in to your Google account, which is the same as your YouTube account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-adsense.JPG"                      alt="monetize adsense"                ></p><p>9. After you have signed in it will show you your channel url next to <strong>My website</strong> and give you a chance to change your language. Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>10. The last step is to fill out all your contact information before you submit your application. Your approval should come within two days.</p><p>11. Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> and check the boxes next to all the videos you want to enable ads for.</p><p>12. Click on <strong>Actions</strong> and then select <strong>Monetize</strong>.</p><p>13. In the window that pops up you will be given a chance to choose what kinds of ads you want to allow in your videos. You must also specify here if you have included paid product placement in your video.</p><p>14. Wait for the review process to finish and ads to start appearing in your videos. If you are using any licensed, royalty free, content (like a music track) then YouTube may ask you to prove you have the rights to it.</p><h4 id="How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads"><a href="#How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads" class="headerlink" title="How much you can get from Ads"></a>How much you can get from Ads</h4><p>The ad revenue generated on YouTube is split between Google and you. You’ll get 55 per cent and Google &#x2F; YouTube will take the remaining 45 per cent. This means that, if an advertiser spends $200 on your channel, you could be earning $110 directly. You’ll earn both for ‘impressions’, which is the number of views the ad received, and ‘click throughs’, which is when someone clicks on the ad for more information.</p><p>Be aware that, in order to get paid, your audience will need to have viewed at least 30 seconds of the ad, or to have clicked through to the advertiser. As a rule, around 15 per cent of viewers will convert into ad revenue, so you can start to calculate just how much your video could be worth.</p><p>To give you an example, if you enjoy daily video views in the region of 3,000 views per day and achieve click through &#x2F; view rates of the average 15 per cent, you’d be earning $0.85 - $1.40 per day or $25 - $43 a month for that one video. If you could increase your views to 5,000 per day, your monthly earnings would rise to $41 - $70 per month.</p><p>When working out how to make money on YouTube, keep in mind that every single video has the potential to earn you money. Although one video might only make a dollar a day, imagine when you’ve got 10 videos performing to the same standard, or 100. As you build up your library of content, you have the potential to earn exponentially more as time goes on.</p><p>Want to know how much you can get from Ads?

In order to get more and better brands advertising in your space, you’ll need to make sure you’ve done all that you can to make your channel attractive to them.</p><ol><li><strong>Target a specific demographic</strong></li></ol><p>Your advertisers want to place their products in front of a very specific audience, so the more embedded in your niche your videos are, the more likely you are to attract investment. If you try to be all things to all people, advertisers are going to see that you’re a risky prospect and will move on to a channel that’s more targeted.</p><p>To check demographics, YouTube has everything already there for you. In the YouTube Studio, you’ll find the exact demographics of your audience profile, including age, country of origin and gender. You can see how appealing your videos are to the people you are targeting by checking the spread of representation here.</p><ol><li><strong>Pay attention to your video metadata</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube metadata is an often-overlooked element of content that is actually incredibly important, both for advertising revenue and for views in general. What we mean when we talk about metadata is your tags, title and description of your video, all of which should make use of high traffic keywords that you’ve researched as being relevant.</p><p>YouTube’s own keyword suggestion tool can be a great place to start finding those golden keywords that will get you noticed. Advertisers often use your metadata to locate videos that their customers are watching, so SEO is crucial here. Not only that, but when viewers are looking for new videos to watch, the SEO of your metadata will define where in the search results you fall, so putting some time and energy into this can get you more views too.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid dodgy video content</strong></li></ol><p>There are some types of content which are just not a good idea for YouTube. In fact, the platform could exclude you from advertising altogether if your content is found to contain any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Sexually suggestive content</strong>: This includes making jokes based around sexual topics, as well as partial nudity of anyone in the video.</li><li><strong>Violence</strong>: This ranges from topics of extremism to videos of people sustaining serious injuries, as well as threats and suggestions of violence.</li><li><strong>Inappropriate language</strong>: Even the most popular YouTubers have started bleeping out their profanities, so avoid vulgar language or anything that could be construed as being threatening.</li><li><strong>Drugs</strong>: Promotion of the use, sale or abuse of drugs and other controlled substances is forbidden.</li><li><strong>Sensitive</strong> <strong>subjects</strong>: This includes references to wars, race crimes, natural disasters, political conflicts, even if you don’t show images of the situation itself.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flagged-content-on-youtube.jpg"                      alt="flagged content"                ></p><p>When you’re considering how do YouTubers make money, you should recognize that those who make the most money avoid creating content that breaches any of these rules. YouTube does notify you if it feels your video is in breach of ‘advertiser friendly’ policies, and you’ll have the chance to contest the ban, but if you steer clear of dodgy content in the first place you shouldn’t run into any issues.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube without ads"></a>Make money on YouTube without ads</h3><p>Of course, life is not all about ads, and with YouTube continuing to tighten its criteria around advertising it can be a good idea not to have all your eggs in one basket. Add to this the huge viewership you’re going to need in order to make serious money, it’s worth investigating other methods of making money on YouTube. Here are some of the best ideas.</p><ol><li><strong>Work with brands</strong></li></ol><p>Influencer marketing is big business right now, and brands all over the world are investing in individuals who have secured the loyalty and trust of their target demographic. Sponsored videos might feature product placement, promoting a product from your sponsor, or you may be asked to produce a particular piece of content to support their campaign. Check out influencer marketplaces like Famebit, Grapevine Logic and Crowdtap to see what’s available to you. If you want to make work with brands, you can check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful influencer marketing platform, which will help you to build good relationship with brands.</p><ol><li><strong>Selling products or merchandise</strong></li></ol><p>Selling ‘merch’ is a great way to discover how to earn money from YouTube. T-shirts, tote bags, mugs, hats…whatever fits with you and your brand can become an amazing source of revenue for your business. Not only does this increase your exposure as a brand by putting it out there into the non-YouTube world, it also gives your fans a way to literally buy into what you’re doing.</p><ol><li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong></li></ol><p>Affiliate marketing doesn’t have to be hard work or complicated. Registering with big sales platforms such as Amazon is often as simple as filling out a couple of forms. Once registered, you can use your own special links to hook your viewers up with a product that you would recommend, and you’ll get a proportion of the final sale value. It’s not only Amazon who offer affiliate programs; most major brands will offer some kind of sales commission, so if you’re in a niche that calls for specialist products to promote, do contact brands directly to find out what they can offer.</p><ol><li><strong>Crowdfund</strong></li></ol><p>If you’ve got an amazingly creative idea but lack of funds is stopping you from putting it into action, crowdfunding could be the way to go. Crowdfunded projects can use the money they make to buy better production equipment, hire people to work on the project, pay for props, anything really. A good way to get started with crowdfunding a particular idea is to create a ‘trailer’ or sneak peek that gives people a better idea of what you want to do. Make sure it gets them so excited that they can’t help but donate to your cause!</p><ol><li><strong>Renting out your video</strong></li></ol><p>You have the ability to rent out individual videos for cold, hard cash, just like a pay per view service. The options for this are in the Creator Studio, where you can set the amount you want to rent it out for as well as creating an enticing trailer to encourage people to buy. Choose to either sell your video permanently, letting the person view it whenever they like, or rent for a limited time, usually 24 to 72 hours.</p><ol><li><strong>License your content to the media</strong></li></ol><p>If you’re lucky enough to make a video that goes viral, you can make serious bucks by licensing it to the wider media. From online news sites to TV shows, there are loads of other content creators out there willing to pay good money to use your amazing clip, and may will reach out to you directly with offers. You can also proactively offer your content for sale via sites like Juken Media, where others can find it and purchase it directly.</p><p>Now you know how to earn money from YouTube, what are you going to try?

There are lots of places to get them.</p><p>We’ve made a list of 6 sites where you can download icons and logos for free for YouTub videos, and explained how they work.</p><blockquote><ul><li><a href="#flaticon">Flaticon.com</a></li><li><a href="#freepik">Freepik.com</a></li><li><a href="#seeklogo">Seeklogo.net</a></li><li><a href="#iconarchive">IconArchive.com</a></li><li><a href="#logaster">Logaster.com</a></li><li><a href="#icons8">Icons8.com</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>You might also want to check out these YouTube channels offering free <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html" >profile picture templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="1-Flaticon-com"><a href="#1-Flaticon-com" class="headerlink" title="1.

There may be a pop up that tells you editing tools are only available to registered users, but it’s wrong. Just close it and keep going, unless you want to register.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon-example-1.jpg"                      alt="Logo Icon on Flaticon"                ></p><p>You can edit the colors in your icon just by clicking on the color you want to replace, and then clicking on the color in the color selector you want to replace it with. I made my birdie FLY.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg"                      alt="Edit Logo Icon on Flaticon"                ></p><p><em>I never apologize for puns.</em></p><p>Once you like the look of your icon, just click Download. You will be prompted to choose a format. PNG is the most popular because it is supported the most places (including on YouTube), and because it allows for a transparent background.</p><p>After clicking on a format you will also be prompted to choose a size for your image. It’s always best to go with the largest image you can – its way easier to shrink things and keep them looking good than it is to have to enlarge them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg"                      alt="download Logo Icon on Flaticon"                ></p><p>Flaticon has a great selection, it’s free, and they make it really easy to edit your creations. I would strongly recommend this site to anyone in the market for an icon or logo.</p><p>Flaticon asks that you include an “Icon made by [author link] from &lt;<a href="http://www.flaticon.com>">www.flaticon.com&gt;</a> ” somewhere (i.e. video description, channel ‘about’ section) when you use their icons for free.</p><h2 id="2-Freepik-com"><a href="#2-Freepik-com" class="headerlink" title="2. Freepik.com"></a>2. Freepik.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>Good selection of icons.</em></li><li><em>No way to customise them on the site.</em></li><li><em>Attribution requried.</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>On freepik, you start off by searching for a theme (like the genre of your YouTube title or the topic of a video, i.e. ‘makeup’ or ‘music’). I searched for ‘cat’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-freepik.jpg"                      alt="download Logo Icon on Freepik"                ></p><p><em>A few of the sets available on freepik. The crown icon means you need to be a paying Premium member, but most things are free.</em></p><p>You can’t edit on freepik, and in order to download for free you need to include an attribution&#x2F;credit to freepik where you use the images.</p><p>You do not choose what format to download your images in on freepik. When you hit ‘Free Download’ it will automatically download a zip file which will contain both a .jpg and a .eps. The EPS is editable in any ‘vector graphics editor’, like Adobe Illustrator, and YouTube supports .jpg files.</p><h2 id="3-Seeklogo-net"><a href="#3-Seeklogo-net" class="headerlink" title="3. Seeklogo.net"></a>3. Seeklogo.net</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>Logos from major brands</em></li><li><em>Great for channels that do product reviews</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Seeklogo.net has a slightly more corporate slant than some of the other sites on this list. It has logos for a lot of major companies and brands available for download.</p><p>In the ‘search’ on Seeklogo.net, you can type in the name of a brand or industry and see if the well-known logo you’re looking for is available. This may be especially useful for people with sports related channels since they have a lot of logos for major teams.</p><p>I searched for YouTube – you never know when you might need the YouTube logo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-icons-logos-on-seeklogo.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on Seeklogo"                ></p><p>Although the site does not advertise PNG in the list of formats on their front page, downloads do include PNG versions (which is useful if you need transparency and don’t have a program which can edit vector files, like .eps).</p><h2 id="4-IconArchive-com"><a href="#4-IconArchive-com" class="headerlink" title="4. IconArchive.com"></a>4. IconArchive.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>Site has an office&#x2F;business slant.</em></li><li><em>Detailed search tool lets you sort by color, theme, etc.</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>IconArchive has a huge selection of icons with somewhat of an office&#x2F;business slant. I searched for ‘flower’ and half the results were of file-folders with flowers on them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive"                ></p><p><em>Could be cool for a lifestyle video about school or work?</em></p><p>My favorite thing about IconArchive is its search features. It allows you to filter results by color, size (down to the specific resolution), category, background color, style, and a lot more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive Editing"                ></p><p>Color is under ‘Display’, meaning that it won’t filter out results that have different colors it’ll just list the color you select first.</p><p>The ‘Category’ filter is useful because there are some genres you probably recognize there, like ‘Lifestyle’. However, you should be careful not to over-filter. This site is pretty literal in how it categorizes. For example – there are no ‘flower’ images under ‘Lifestyle’.</p><p>Downloads are available in different sizes and formats including PNG. PNG is always a good option because it is supported by YouTube and includes transparent backgrounds.</p><p>Note that all of your different download buttons will be located underneath your image. They favor those ads that look like ‘download’ or ‘start now’ buttons, and the ads sit right next to the images on the right, so it’s easy to get confused and click on the ad.</p><h2 id="5-Logaster-com"><a href="#5-Logaster-com" class="headerlink" title="5. Logaster.com"></a>5. Logaster.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>You’ll have to pay for larger images.</em></li><li><em>Focused more on businesses.</em></li><li><em>Incorporates your channel name.</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Logaster is really a service for businesses – they make and sell business cards, letterheads, and other office-y things like that. However, they are still a good choice for YouTubers because they have a free logo creator. Sort of.</p><p>You actually have to pay $9.99 to get larger images and remove the watermark, but the process is free.</p><p>When you arrive on Logaster there’s a button right on their home page that says ‘Create a logo for free’. Click on it.</p><p>In Step 1 it’ll ask for your company name and an activity type. You just need to put in your channel name and choose something from the activity drop down that you focus on in your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-on-logaster.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster Start Window"                ></p><p>My heart burns with the secret desire to be YouTube’s Neil Degrasse Tyson (it doesn’t really, but he is super cool) so I tried ‘Katie Does Science’ and ‘Science, Studies, Education’. Here’s what it came up with:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-suggestions-on-logaster.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster"                ></p><p><em>There are 10 pages of suggestions!</em></p><p>You can see how, unless you have a short channel name, you’re probably not going to be able to use any of these as an icon, but a lot of them would look cool on a banner. There’s an ‘Edit Logo Concept’ button which allows you to make changes to the layout, but you can still only choose from preset layouts. For example, some logo concepts allow you to choose whether the icon is above your text or next to it.</p><p>After you click ‘save’ in the last step you’ll be prompted to provide an email address and password. Once you sign in, you’ll be able to download a small logo for free, or purchase the higher resolution image.</p><p>I personally wouldn’t recommend buying an image from here unless your channel is for your small business and you need things like branded business cards and letterhead. This site might be better for gathering inspiration than actually downloading a logo from.</p><h2 id="6-Icons8-com"><a href="#6-Icons8-com" class="headerlink" title="6. Icons8.com"></a>6. Icons8.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>You need to link back to them to use their icons.</em></li><li><em>You can edit the colors on the site and even add details.</em></li><li><em>There’s a size limit on the free service (100x100px)</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>At Icons8 they have free and paid services. If you download an icon for free it will be a PNG file (which should be fine, YouTube supports PNG and it’s good for transparency) that is no larger than 100x100px. This is not ideal since YouTube recommends 800x800px for profile pictures, but it’s not necessarily a deal breaker either. Profile pictures render down to much smaller than that.</p><p>You will also need to link to Icons8 if you use their icons for free (i.e. in the ‘about’ section of your channel page).</p><p>To get started on Icons8, type something into the search bar on the home page that you think might work as an icon or as part of whatever graphics you have planned. I typed in ‘game’ for this one, since gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube. Here are a few of the results that came up:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg"                      alt="Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8"                ></p><p><em>Lower down in the results there were different kinds of sports balls, hand-held gaming systems, playing cards, joy sticks, baseball caps and more.</em></p><p>After you find an icon you like, click on it and it will appear on the right side of your screen where you’ll be able to make a few changes (an editing screen will pop up once you start clicking on things). You can edit your colors, overlay small decals, add text, and add a border, change your background and adjust your size. Here’s the editing screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg"                      alt="Edit Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8"                ></p><p>You can give your icon a pretty different look from its default. Check this out:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gaming-icons-logos-background-on-icons8.jpg"                      alt="Change Gaming Logo Icon background on Icons8"                ></p><p>You cannot download your icon from the editing screen. You need to click Save, and then download it from the main display screen here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg"                      alt="Donwload Gaming Logo Icon  on Icons8"                ></p><p>You can change the size with that drop down menu, but you’ll be limited in your options if you don’t want to pay.</p><p>I downloaded my image and tried to see how it would look as an icon&#x2F;profile picture. As you can see, it was pretty blurry in the preview:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-gaming-icons-logos-made-with-icons8.jpg"                      alt="Add Gaming Logo Icon made with icons8 to YouTube"                ></p><p>However, the preview is larger than the actual profile picture. Once I set it, it looked alright.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-gaming-icons-logos-made-with-icons8.jpg"                      alt="Preview Gaming Logo Icon made with icons8 to YouTube"                ></p><p>Looking for somewhere you can build your own icon&#x2F;logo from scratch?

Choosing A Potential Partner"></a>1. Choosing A Potential Partner</h2><p>Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.</p><p>A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg"                      alt="Choosing A Potential Partner"                ></p><p><em>Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?</em></p><p>Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.</p><p>Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.</p><p>There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A" >Mr.Kate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.</p><p><em>Mr.Kate makes over **<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub_confirmation=1" >MyLifeAsEva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**’s bedroom.</em></p><p>Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.</p><p>A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!</p><h2 id="2-How-to-contact-a-partner"><a href="#2-How-to-contact-a-partner" class="headerlink" title="2. How to contact a partner"></a>2. How to contact a partner</h2><p>Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the <strong>About</strong> tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says <strong>for business inquiries</strong>, click on <strong>view email address</strong>, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.</p><p>Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.</p><h2 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Popular Types of Collab Videos"></a>3. Popular Types of Collab Videos</h2><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ"><strong>Gabrielle</strong></a>talks about different types of collabs and how well they work.</em></p><p>In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:</p><h4 id="1-Shout-outs"><a href="#1-Shout-outs" class="headerlink" title="#1. Shout outs"></a>#1. Shout outs</h4><p>In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.</p><p>I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.</p><h4 id="2-Guest-spots"><a href="#2-Guest-spots" class="headerlink" title="2. Guest spots"></a>2. Guest spots</h4><p>This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.</p><p>For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!</p><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg" >Matthias <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> gets <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle" >NateWantsToBattle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals.</em></p><p>Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.</p><p>Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.</p><h4 id="3-Long-distance-collabs"><a href="#3-Long-distance-collabs" class="headerlink" title="3. Long distance collabs"></a>3. Long distance collabs</h4><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg" >Lauren <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in Toronto and <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ" >Aja <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense.</em></p><p>Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.</p><h2 id="4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations"><a href="#4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"></a>4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations</h2><p>Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.</p><p>Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/getting-most-out-of-collaborations.jpg"                      alt="Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"                ></p><p><em>Kitty got the collab!

In order to do so effectively, you have to drag the bar at either end of your clip towards the other end in order to shorten the clip conveniently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-length-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="edit video length in youtube"                ></p><p>What is more, if you want to increase the length, you have to drag the bar to the opposite end – outwards. There is going to be an indicator which is going to appear at the bottom of the clip, and it’s going to show you the overall duration of the file, and it’s going to adjust itself as you slide the bars accordingly.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Save-the-Clip"><a href="#Step-4-Save-the-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 Save the Clip"></a>Step 4 Save the Clip</h4><p>Of course, you would have to save the clip in order for the changes to reflect. Even though this might seem like a particularly obvious thing to do, you would be surprise to find out that a lot of people get everything done and then discard the changes by forgetting to save them and their effort goes to waste.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-igtv-vs-youtube-a-comprehensive-feature-breakdown/"><u>[Updated] Understanding IGTV Vs.
