## VisualCut Pro

Picsart is a platform that allows users to take photos and videos that they can then edit on the platform. Once the images or videos are edited to their satisfaction, users can then share them on each other’s social media pages.

It is one of the most popular media creation and editing apps with 1 billion uses around the world and it can be used on Android devices, iOS devices, and web browsers on PC. But Picsart is not a free solution and you may end up paying up to $48 a month to use the platform.

This is why we’ve searched for some of the most useful picsart alternatives that are completely free to use and work just as well.

## Picsart Photo and Video Editor

This app has more than 150 million downloads from users all over the world. It is available on the Google Play Store and offers numerous options to edit your photos and videos to create a more professional look and feel.

Some of the things that you can do using this app include creating collages, adding stickers, removing and even swapping backgrounds and so much more. You can edit existing images or use the built-in camera to take photos or record videos that you can then edit.

Here’s how you can use this app to edit your images or videos in numerous ways;

Step 1: Begin by installing the Picsart Photo and video editor on your Android device. To do that, just open the Google Play Store and search for the app and then install it.

Step 2: Open it after installation and tap on the “+” button to choose the video or photo that you would like to edit.

Step 3: To apply filters to the video or image, tap “Effects” and choose the filter that you would like to use. In the same section, you will see several tools that you can use to customize your video in many ways including adding additional images and saving the completed video.

## Video Editor & Maker- Love Edit

Love-Edit is a mobile video editor that you can use to create professional videos that you can use for various purposes including marketing purposes. The tool has a simple user interface that can be used to make simple changes to a video such as cutting away sections of the video that you don’t want to include the video or even merging various clips to create a single video.

And since it is very easy to use, this tool can help you edit even the longest video in just a matter of minutes. But there are some users who complain that the app will begin lagging as soon as you start editing a video that is longer than 5 minutes.

Here’s how you can use this app to make changes to your videos;

Step 1: Start by installing the app on your device. Just go to the Google Play Store and search for the app. When you find it, tap “Install” to begin installing the app.

In much the same way, you can add filters and even add additional images to the video. Do not forget to save the video once you are done with the editing process.

## iPhone Picsart Photo & Video Editor

The Picsart Photo & Video Editor for iOS is another great tool that you can use to edit photos and videos on your iPhone. It can be used to make simple changes to the photo or video such as adding a simple filter, but it is also a useful solution when you want to make significant changes to the photos or video such as removing backgrounds and replacing them with other images.

One of the things we love about this app is that you can use it to add text to an existing image or video and you have over 200 designer fonts to choose from. it also has a lot of effects to choose from for both images and videos. For images, you can choose from a large library of stickers to add to the image and for videos, you can add photos, music, and even trim the videos to the desired length.

Here’s how you can use this app to edit a video in various ways;

Step 1: If you don’t already have the app installed on your device, go to the App Store, search for it and install it on your device. If you already have it, make sure that you are running the latest version before using it.

Step 2: When the installation is complete, open the app and then click on the “+” icon to import the video that you would like to edit into the app. You can choose a video from your Photos app or any other source on your device.

Step 3: If you would like to add a filter to the video, tap “Effects” and then choose the filter that you would like to use. To add an image to the video, tap “Images” and then select the image that you would like to add. Resize the image to fit the screen.

## Conclusion

There are very many apps that you can use to edit photos and videos on your device. But most of them can be quite expensive. The options above are easy to use, cost-effective, and have the necessary features to help you easily edit your images and videos.

# How to Record your iPhone or iPad Screen for YouTube

There are a lot of reasons why you might want to use footage recorded from the screen of your apple device in your YouTube videos. Some people like to make YouTube tutorials about iPhone or iPad apps, others like to share their gaming experiences, and some need to use footage taken from their devices for presentations. Even if you do not think these kinds of videos suit your vlog, screen recording is a useful tool to have on your belt. You never know when one of your subscribers is going to ask you about your favorite mobile games.

Basically, there are three ways to record YouTube video on iPhone/iPad, including the built-in screen recorder (if you have [updated to iOS 11](https://support.apple.com/ios/update)), connecting iPhone to Mac and the last, some third party screen recorder. In this article, you will learn the three powerful methods one by one.

* [**Part1: Recording your iPhone screen in iOS 11**](#part1)
* [**Part2: Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector**](#part3)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## 1\. Recording your iPhone screen in [iOS 11](https://www.apple.com/lae/ios/ios-11/)

You can find more information in this article: [How to Record iPhone/iPad’s Screen in iOS 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 2\. Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac

If you have a Mac then you already have all the software you need.

**Step 1**: Connect your tablet or smartphone to your computer using a USB port, and then open QuickTime on your Mac. In QuickTime select ‘File’ and ‘New Movie Recording’. A recording window will pop up.

**Step 2**: In the recording window there will be a red ‘record’ button. Next to that button there will be an arrow. Click the arrow and a menu of recording options will appear. In the section where it says ‘Camera’ select your iPhone or iPad. In this menu you can also choose whether or not to record audio from your device, such sound effects from games.

**Step 3**: Once you are finished in this menu click record to begin recording the screen of your device. Click ‘stop’ when you are finished recording.

Although you can download a version of QuickTime for PC, the PC version does not have a screen recording option. If you have a PC you will need to use the second method.

## 3\. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)

If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your device’s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.

**Step 1**: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at [Airsquirrels.com](http://www.airsquirrels.com/).Next, you need to have Apple’s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.

**Step 2**: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.

**Step 3**: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computer’s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.

**Step 4**: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.

You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.

If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.

## Conclusion

After reading the three ways to record YouTube on iPhone/iPad, I am sure you want to give it a try. If you have any questions, please let us know!
