The [YouTube Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an essential aspect of managing a successful channel (click here to learn more about the [Analytics section of your Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). Using the tools available in the Creator studio you can manage your videos, interact with your audience, and keep track of important video statistics.

The Creator Studio’s interface is customizable so you can add or remove widgets based on the tools that you most commonly use.

On the main dashboard of the Creator Studio, you will see a menu that includes your video manager, live streaming support, community page, channel page, analytics, translations, and transcriptions.

Also on the dashboard, you can see analytics for the most successful videos that you have posted.

## Adjusting the Dashboard

Pinning new charts to the dashboard will ensure that all of the data you need most often is easily viewable upon first entering the Creator Studio. All you need to do to add new widgets to the dashboard sidebar is to use the **add widget** feature.

Making adjustments to your current widgets simply involves clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner to add custom tiles as well as rearrange the order of the various widgets that you have selected.

## YouTube Creator Studio Tools

**Video Manager:** from the Video Manager section you can view any of the videos that you have posted to YouTube. This menu includes all of your uploaded videos whether they are public, unlisted, or private. You can see advanced statistics on every one of the videos you posted as well as download MP4s of your videos for re-editing. The video manager allows you to very quickly select multiple videos and then add them to a playlist.

**Live streaming**: YouTube has made it easy for anyone with a verified account to go live. There are even special monetization features specifically for live streaming. Streaming is especially vital to the gaming genre on YouTube.

**Analytics:** the analytic section is essential to your success as a video creator. Through analytics, you can see which of your videos are most successful in terms of watch time, views, or monetization and you can even check how many new subscribers individual videos are attracting to your channel. This information is important because once you know what’s working you can keep doing it and start growing your channel faster.

Other information you can access through your Creator Studio includes the demographics (nationality, gender, age) of your viewers, video comments, your subscriber list, and any information related to copyright strikes.

How many times a week do you check your stats in the YouTube Creator Studio?
