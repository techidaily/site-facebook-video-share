## Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:

**Note:** YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar's white or grey/black area along the edges.

**●** YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop/PC Version:

If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)

**●** YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:

There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.

**●** YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version

Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.

Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:
