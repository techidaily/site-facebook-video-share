It is no secret that the iPhone and the iPad are the most popular smartphone and tablet respectively. You could argue that Samsung has impressive sales and is almost at par with Apple but in regards to sheer dominance or superiority, the South Korea based conglomerate bows down to the American tech juggernaut. YouTube is indisputably the most popular video hosting and sharing site in the world. It doesn’t help that YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine giant that also owns Android which powers all popular Samsung smartphones at the moment. As a result, what you get is a tad incompatible with YouTube and iPhone or iPad. Downloading YouTube videos is very simple if you are using an Android smartphone or a Windows computer. It is not so when you are using an iPhone, iPad or even a Mac.

Fortunately, there are ways you can download YouTube videos to iPhone or iPad, and we aren’t talking about YouTube’s promise of offline video streaming. Here is a complete guide.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

### First, you need a video downloader

You need a third party app which is approved by Apple and available in App Store. There are quite a few free video downloader apps that you can check. But do make sure that the app is active or usable right now. Apple is a tad infamous for deleting some of the apps from its store from time to time. If that happens after you have installed and started using a video downloader, then you can just remove it and opt for another. Most of these free video downloader apps will save your videos within the app. Some would add them to the videos in your Camera Roll. You can use AirPlay to watch the videos if you have an Apple TV. The videos saved by downloader apps will not be found in the native Videos app of iPhone or iPad. When you search for such apps, use ‘video downloader’ or ‘YouTube downloader’ as the keywords.

### Find a suitable app, download it for free and install it

Some of the downloader apps will have premium or pro versions. You don’t need to pay before you have used the free or basic version. Once installed, start the app. Most of these apps have a built-in browser which should allow you to access YouTube. In most cases, you would get to m.youtube.com. If there is no default address, then save the mobile version of YouTube as the default URL. On iPad, you can go for <www.youtube.com>.

### Downloading Youtube videos to iPhone or iPad

In all likelihood, you are familiar with how YouTube works. Search for a video that you wish to download, pick the one you want from the search results and it would automatically start to play. In some cases, you may have to click the play button or tap on the video thumbnail for it to start playing. As the video begins to stream or buffer, you would find an icon of the app, usually bobbing or hovering over the screen playing the video. You can tap on this icon, which could be a disk sign or the logo of the app. As you tap on it, you would have a popup that will prompt you to download the video that you are watching.

Depending on the app you are using, the download may begin immediately after tapping on the download icon or there can be another step, which will perhaps show you the list of downloading videos or videos that you have downloaded already. If the download doesn’t start immediately, there could be another button to initiate the download. Tap on it and you are done. The download would be automated and you don’t need to do anything else. You can also have your iPhone or iPad in sleep mode and the download would be completed, as long as there is an active internet connection. You can also see the progress made. Once the download or downloads are complete, you would get a notification. The video downloaded would be within the app’s video library or in your files.

Some apps rename the videos that are being downloaded so it is best you opt for a title or a name that will help you to recognize the video immediately. Other apps will keep the name of the video that appears on YouTube.

Almost all video downloader apps for iPhone and iPad will allow you to watch these videos offline. Some apps may need an internet connection to open but the videos saved will not require any internet to be played and replayed.

Given the fact that there are many video downloader apps and you cannot be sure of the experience of any, you will have to indulge in a bit of trial and error to find the best one.
