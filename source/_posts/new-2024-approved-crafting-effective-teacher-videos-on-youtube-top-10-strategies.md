## 10 Tips for teachers creating a YouTube Channel

 Below are some of the tips for teachers who aspire to create successful YouTube channels:

#### 1\. Understand how YouTube channel work

 It is imperative for you to learn and understand the working of YouTube before you think about how to create a YouTube channel. Learn the basics of creating a channel, uploading and editing a video, how to find other related videos and other information that will make it easy for you to successfully create a channel.

#### 2\. Define your content

 It is equally important to know what kind of content you will upload when you create a YouTube channel. Ideally, the channel should not be a jack of all trade, even if you teach multiple subjects. It should be dedicated either to a particular subject or topics to make it more relevant to your students. Also determine if you will shoot the videos or upload from other sources.

#### 3\. Shoot your videos

 If you decide to shoot the videos on your own, consider the following:

* Always shoot on landscape
* Ensure there is adequate light and keep the lighting consistent
* Have a shot list, or a guide to show you how you will progress on recording the educational video. This can be compared to a lesson plan in traditional teaching
* Avoid shakes and keep the shots relatively short
* Invest in a good camera and good microphone

#### 4\. Edit and upload the videos

 After you are done with the shooting, it is imperative to edit the video before finally uploading them to your YouTube channel. You can use Wondershare Fillmora for the editing.

#### 5\. Create a playlist

 When you create YouTube channel, it is recommended that you have a playlist to guide your students to the right categories and so that it becomes easier for them to find the content they are searching for.

#### 6\. Block Video Ads

 Be sure to block video ads from your channel because they can be irritating and annoying and they will likely distract the attention of your viewers.

#### 7\. Add descriptions

 Descriptions will enable your students to know what the video is all about in a glance and without going through the whole content.

#### 8\. Block comments

 If you allow comments when you create a YouTube Channel, you may receive a lot of spam comments and sometimes the channel will be better off with the comments blocked.

#### 9\. Add questions to the videos

 You need to include questions on the videos to keep the viewers attentive and have them hooked until the end of the videos.

#### 10\. Promote your channel

 If you want more people to know your channel and gain more popularity, you can consider promoting your channel through various methods such as the social media and YouTube ads amongst others.

#### Conclusion

 A YouTube channels has become one of the teaching tools teachers all around the world are adding to their arsenal. The channels make it easier and more convenient for teachers to pass knowledge to students in ways that were never possible in the past. It is thus the desire of every teacher to create a YouTube channel to make their work easier. The tips provided above will help the teachers start YouTube channels in the right manner and set them up for success from the word go.
