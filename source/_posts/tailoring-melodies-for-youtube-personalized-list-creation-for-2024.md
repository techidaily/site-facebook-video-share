 **yt:crop=16:9**

 This tag zooms in on the video because of which the contents at the borders (black bars in this case) do not appear anymore.

 **yt:stretch=16:9**

 This tag stretches the video in the aspect ratio of 16:9\. It is used to view the video in wide-screen format.

 **yt:stretch=4:3**

 if your video is appearing in wide-screen format, but you want it to display in 720 x 480 pixels, apply this tag. It scales down the video 4:3 aspect.

 Try any of the above software to remove black bars from existing YouTube videos or the new videos and make it pleasant to viewers.
