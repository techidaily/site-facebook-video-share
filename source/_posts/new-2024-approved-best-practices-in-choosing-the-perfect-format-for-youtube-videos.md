Uploading your content in the best video format for YouTube can save you a lot of frustration. In this article, we will teach you about some of the [best video formats and settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

To upload a video to YouTube you have to make sure that you are using one of the video file formats that is supported by the platform itself. Here they are:

  \- MP4

 \- MOV

 \- AVI

 \- FLV

 \- 3GPP

 \- WMV

 \- WebM

 \- MPEGS

 **YouTube recommends uploading your videos as MP4 files.** Some benefits of MP4s are that the files are not as large as AVIs, they provide better quality than FLVs, and they often display with the same quality or better as you would get watching the video on a native video player. Other file formats like 3GPP and MPEG-PS generally have resolutions too small for high-resolution tablets or desktop devices.

If your phone or video editing software does not output MP4 videos, consider getting video editing software or a conversion program that can (like Filmora Video Editor).

Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program that can export to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, F4V, MKV, TS, 3GP, MPEG-2, WEBM, GIF, and MP3\. You can convert a video to an MP4 simply by importing it into Filmora, dragging it into the timeline, and exporting it in the MP4 format.

## The Best Upload Settings for YouTube

**The best video code:**

**The best video format:** MP4

Audio should be produced using the LC format and stereo 5.1 or standard stereo. You can upload separate MP3 audio format files for voiceovers if you need to.

The aspect ratio for a video should be 16:9 so that it won’t have black bars on the side when uploaded to YouTube. YouTube has also made it possible for 9:16 (portrait) style videos to be viewed without black bars, full screen, using their iOS app.

You should export in at least 30 frames per second. Many creators push that to 60 frames per second, which is better for most types of videos (although it may not make a noticeable difference for others).

The maximum size for quick upload and load time on YouTube is generally under 2gb. Luckily MP4 offers a great degree of compression without sacrificing too much image quality.

If you scale down the file size of the video by reducing the resolution or choosing a format with more compression, that can cause you to lose quality. If you need a smaller file, it's always better to scale down the length of a video rather than continually compress the file or lose frames from the video.

Although a 2 GB file of a very long will easily upload to YouTube, it will probably be very low quality.

 Do you agree that MP4 is the best video format for YouTube, or do you use something else?
