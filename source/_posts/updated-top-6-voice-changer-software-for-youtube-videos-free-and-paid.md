There are a lot of reasons you might want to change your voice in a YouTube video.

Or, you might want to create multiple characters for your vlog and give them all unique voices.

This article will introduce you to some of the best voice changers available at different price points, from free to $100\.

If your goal is only to use a false voice then Audacity might be more complicated than you want as you will have to make all your changes manually. There are no pre-set voices, but you can change both the pitch and tempo of your audio recordings and do a lot of other detailed editings. You can record audio using Audacity, or import audio files to edit. Audacity is available at Audacityteam.org.
