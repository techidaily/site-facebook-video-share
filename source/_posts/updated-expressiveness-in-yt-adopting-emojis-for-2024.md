## Details On Youtube Music

YouTube recently added 'YouTube Music' to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don't have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don't want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube's music.

Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.

This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.

#### Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit

The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube's blog and Google's 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it's a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube's new 2 GB size restriction.
