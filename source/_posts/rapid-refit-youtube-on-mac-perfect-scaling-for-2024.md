YouTube is one of the demanding platforms with more than [2.3 billion users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/) worldwide as of 2021\. And, in this digitally oriented world, you're left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to **resize YouTube videos** as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube's aspect ratio, it's the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.

So, let's get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.

## Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?

For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we've come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.

It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!

YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.

* **240p:** 426x240 pixels
* **360p:** 640x360 pixels
* **480p:** 854x480 pixels
* **720p:** 1280x720 pixels
* **1080p:** 1920x1080 pixels
* **1440p:** 2560x1440 pixels
* **2160p:** 3840x2160 pixels
* **43200p:** 7680×4320 pixels

Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.

Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to **resize YouTube video** is perfect as 16:9, which we'll diversify in the following three sections.

**1\. Computer**

On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9\. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.

**2\. Android Phone**

In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it's square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.

**3\. iPad & iPhone**

Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it's square, horizontal, or vertical.

Before we let you know how to **resize YouTube videos**, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.

* Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.
* Search for ideas and topics.
* Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.
* Ensure the best YouTube video editing.
* Optimize YouTube videos.
