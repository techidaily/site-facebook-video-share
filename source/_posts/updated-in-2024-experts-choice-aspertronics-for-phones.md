The types of ASMR triggers the app offers, the diversity of its video selection or the quality of the audio are all important factors you will have to consider while choosing the ASMR app. Moreover, some apps enable you to customize the relaxing sounds that help you fall asleep. So, let's take a look at what the best relaxation ASMR apps for Android and iOS have to offer.

### 1\. [TeasEar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teasear-asmr-slime-simulator/id1439312630)

The app also lets you interact with each texture you generate, as you just have to place your fingers onto the surface of your Smartphone in order to produce the sound that can potentially trigger the ASMR.

However, the free version of the app grants you access to only a limited amount of triggers and you must purchase a weekly or monthly subscription in order to unlock all the triggers this app has to offer.
