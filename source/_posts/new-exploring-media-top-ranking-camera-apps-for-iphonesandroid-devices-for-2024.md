Smartphone cameras, especially the newest models, are capable of recording great videos. Depending on what kind of videos you make, you might not actually need a separate camera.

The majority of phone cameras record in full HD now, and some can even manage 4K. Where things get tricky is shooting in less than ideal conditions, i.e low light. You cannot make the same adjustments and customizations to your settings with a smartphone camera as you can with a DSLR.

You don’t have the same level of control.

But don’t worry – there are 5 **camera apps** that will allow you to [record videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and get even more creative with how you use your phone’s camera.

### 1\. Open Camera – Free, Android Only

![open camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-camera1.png)

This camera app gives you control over your exposure, flash, focus, ISO, shutter speed, torch, and white balance. How much control you have is up to you. If managing all these things manually is a hassle for you, you can use its automatic or semi-manual modes instead of manual mode.

This is a great camera app to record time-lapses. It is simplistic compared to some of the other apps on this list, but it is also extremely easy to use.

### 2\. ProShot - $4, iOS or Android

![proshot app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/proshot2.png)

ProShot lets you adjust your frame rate, which is important if you want to shoot slow motion or time-lapse videos. You can also adjust your brightness while filming. One of the most useful features of this camera app is that it provides a real-time audio level meter, so you won’t be surprised by a poor sound recording when you watch your videos back.

### 3\. ProCamera - $5, iOS Only

![procamera app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/procamera3.png)

This is one of the most frequently recommended camera apps for iPhones. It makes it easy for you to adjust your focus, iOS, and exposure. You can also play with different filters and effects right in the app. One of the only downsides of this app is that some of its most useful features, like Lowlight Plus, are in-app purchases.

### 4\. Sun Seeker - $10, iOS or Android

![sun seeker app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sun-seeker4.png)

A lot of the time when you’re shooting with your phone, you’re shooting outside. When you’re shooting outside, the most important thing you need to keep track of is the sun. Sun Seeker is the perfect app for figuring out where the sun will be in the sky at any given time, which will tell you the best time to go out and make your video.

For more information on making videos with natural light, check out [Indoor Natural Lighting Tips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Besides just keeping track of the sun, Sun Seeker provides an augmented reality view of its path and how it will affect specific locations.

### 5\. FiLMiC Pro - $10, iOS or Android

![filmic pro app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmic-pro5.png)

This is probably the best all-purpose camera app available. It gives you exactly the same kind of control over your smartphone camera as you would have over a DSLR. You can manually adjust your focus, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, tint, and color temperature. There are even voice processing audio filters, so you can capture better audio while you’re shooting and have less to fix in post.

### Final Words

Because mobile cameras already perform so well, it can be easy to think to have more to adjust would only make things more complicated. However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.

Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality **camera app**.
