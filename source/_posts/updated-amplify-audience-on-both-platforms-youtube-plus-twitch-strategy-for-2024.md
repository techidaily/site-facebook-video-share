Part 3: [Bonus Tips | Enlarge your Live Stream Performance!](#step3)

## Part 1: How Can You Stream on Twitch and YouTube at the Same Time?

To stream simultaneously on multiple platforms, a certain program or application is required to provide you with the required tools to enable you to broadcast your content. Several programs provide the option to stream to multiple websites at the same time e.g., Restream, Streamlabs Prime, and MelonApp.

### Restream

Restream.io is a service that provides you with the option to broadcast your content to more than 30 different platforms including Twitch and YouTube. When you log in, you can choose the channels you wish to broadcast on and restream will issue a unique key for you.

After you have selected your desired selection, go to your broadcasting software, and choose Restream.io as your preferred service and insert your unique key provided by Restream.

Restream will let you use their services for free provided you use it with their watermark. It is recommended for newer users but if you wish to remove the watermark and go ad-free you will have to upgrade your plan.

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you stream using Restream.io

### Step 1: Sign up or log in

The first step is to sign up on Restream. It will require you to choose a unique username, password and enter a valid email address.

### Step 2: Choose your desired Platforms

From the list of different platforms, choose the ones you wish to stream to and add your channels by authorizing with the required credentials. Restream has an option of more than 30 platforms including YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

### Step 3: Choose your subscription plan

Choose your desired plan that caters to your needs. Keep in mind that Restream is 100% free but free accounts do not come with recording or storage and will show a Restream watermark.

Do you like the animated elements in Wondershare Filmora? Do you want to learn how to make your own?

A little while ago, we posted a list of YouTube channels where you could [get free green screen effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). All of these effects consisted of animations on green backgrounds. To use them, you pull the clip into the PIP track of your Filmora project and use the green screen feature to make the background transparent. It’s pretty easy.

In this post, we’re going to kick things up a bit. Here is a list of places where you can get free lessons on creating your own animated video effects.

**Animated Video Effect Courses:**

[Mt. Mograph](#mtmograph)

[Richard Harrington on Lynda](#lynda)

[Bloop Animation](#bloop)

[Video Copilot](#videocopilot)

 ![Video Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-video-effects.png)

 All of these resources will teach Adobe After Effects, or a similar paid software. If you do not have access to Adobe After Effects, you might want to check out our post on [affordable animation software for video creators](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-or-cheap-animation-software-for-video-creators-122.html).

## **[Mt. Mograph](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUSgx9qc%5FNydrOL59xbJIA)**

On this YouTube channel, motion graphics specialist Matt offers free animation tutorials using a variety of programs including Adobe After Effects and Cinema 4D. His lessons are for a range of skill levels, from beginner to advanced. If you are just starting out then Mt.Mograph is a great resource.

## **[Richard Harrington on Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Rich-Harrington/120-1.html)**

Lynda isn’t free, but the 10-day free trial period is definitely long enough for you to watch this two-hour course.

What’s great about this course is that it assumes you have no animation experience, and it walks you through the main thing a lot of YouTubers want to learn animation for – creating an animated logo.

## **[Bloop Animation](https://www.bloopanimation.com/)**

 Most of the video animation courses on this site are paid, but they have a lot of cool free tutorials as well. The focus is more on animating figures/cartoons than video effects, but if you have any interest in animation more generally then this is a great place to start learning. They even have a free ebook you can download which is targeted at beginners.

## **[Video Copilot](http://www.videocopilot.net/)**

This site has a huge number of free After Effects tutorials. There are basic introductory lessons, and really advanced classes on creating custom cinematic FX, like explosions. There’s even a playlist on title design, which will be useful for anyone looking to create an intro sequence for their videos.
